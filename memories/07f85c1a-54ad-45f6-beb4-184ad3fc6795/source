    <h1>Mailsync</h1>

Mailsync is a way of synchronizing a collection of mailboxes.  The
algorithm is a 3-way diff.  Two mailboxes are simultaneously compared
to a record of the state of both mailboxes at last sync.  New messages
and message deletions are propagated between the two mailboxes.  If
you're familiar with CVS, it's the same principle, except there's no
opportunity for conflicts.<p>

Mailsync can be used for many things.  I wrote it for synchronizing my
desktop mail with my laptop.  You can also use it if your mail is kept
on an IMAP server, but your favorite mail client doesn't totally grok
IMAP---for instance, I use VM under Emacs, and VM keeps a copy of my
mail in my home directory, and I synchronize that with the IMAP
server.  You can keep your mail in arbitrarily many places and keep it
all consistent.<p>

Mailsync is based on the "c-client" library developed at the
University of Washington.  C-client was designed for writing IMAP
clients, but it also can access local mailbox files in many formats,
with a nearly consistent API.  Mailsync's mailboxes can be on IMAP
servers, on the local filesystem in UNIX, MH, or any other format
c-client supports.<p>

What about "detached client" mode in an IMAP client?  Mailsync
attempts to solve the same problem in a different way.  The "detached
client" idea assumes that there's a master server and a
periodically-connected client.  Mailsync does not designate a server
or a client.  (In fact, it acts sort of like a client that arbitrates
between two servers.)<p>

Currently, the concept of message identity is based entirely on the
Message-ID field.  This may change.<p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<ul>
<li>Get Mailsync from <a
	  href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=6374">the
	  SourceForge project page</a> (click on "[tar/gz]").
<li>You'll also need the <tt>c-client library</tt>. It might already
    be included in your distribution. Otherwise:

<ul>
<li> Go to the <a
	      href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap">UW imap
	      download directory</a> and get the latest stable
<tt>imap-200x.tar.Z</tt> archive.  <br>
<b>Warning:</b> Do not use anything between <tt>imap-4.7c2</tt> and
	    <tt>RELEASE-CANDIDATE.3 2000</tt>.  There is a bug in
	    <tt>imap-2000.BETA</tt> which can delete mail from a UNIX
	    mailbox when it's not supposed to.  Please upgrade your
	    <tt>c-client.a</tt> and recompile
	    <tt>mailsync</tt>. (7/6/2000) 

<li> If you have a version of 
<tt>c-client</tt> installed from before the <tt>imap-2000</tt> beta
	    releases, you can still make
		Mailsync work.  The only issue is C/C++ linkage, and
		you can fix that by downloading <a
		  href="http://mailsync.sourceforge.net/c-client.h">c-client.h</a>.
</ul>
