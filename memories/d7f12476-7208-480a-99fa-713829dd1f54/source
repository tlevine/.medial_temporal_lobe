					<p>I was a lucky one.  When I was in college in the early 70’s, my draft number was 18.  I graduated in 1973 shortly after the end of the Vietnam War so my number was never called and I never had to serve.   I was a lucky one.  </p>
<p><img src="http://demographicsgoldmine.com/images/veteransday2012.jpg" style="float:right; margin:10px">Many of that time weren’t so lucky, they served, many died and even those returning home were never the same.  See, we didn’t look at or honor our veterans of that time period the way we do today.  It’s such a good thing that we’ve grown up to better understand the sacrifices those men and women made and are still making today.  </p>
<p>So it’s time to honor them and to do so we need to understand who they are.  The Census Bureau provides a lot of information to profile our veterans.   Here are some recent stats from the 2011 American Community Survey&#8230;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 21.5 million military veterans in the U.S. and 1.6 million are women.<br />
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons of all races and ethnic groups serve our nation: 2.3 million Blacks; 1.2 million Hispanics; 265,000 Asians; 153,000 American Indian or Alaska Native; 27,000 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and 17.2 million non-Hispanic Whites.<br />
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.2 million vets are 65 and older while 1.8 million are under 35.<br />
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 7.5 million Vietnam era veterans; 5.1 million served during the Gulf Wars (from August 1990 to present); 1.8 million serving from World War II and 2.4 million from the Korean War.  Those serving in peacetime only numbered 5.4 million.<br />
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t know that veteran’s disabilities are rated on a scale from 1 to 100 to determine their eligibility for compensation.  3.5 million vets have a service connected disability rating and 810,000 have a rating of 70 or higher!  </p>
<p>We all know someone who has served – family, friends, loved ones, distant relations.  We know them individually and personally.  Sometimes it’s helpful to recognize and say thank you to our veterans as the collective whole who have sacrificed for this country.  Thank you.</p>

					<p>The survey estimates vary but AARP and others studying our older population note that between 75 and 90 percent of our seniors want to stay home.  There’s an inherent conflict here that isn’t always keeping the wishes of people in the forefront.  </p>
<p>I attended a forum hosted by the <a href="http://www.albanyguardiansociety.org">Albany Guardian Society</a> yesterday titled The Village Movement: Supporting Seniors at Home.  What an education!  Look around you and you’ll find senior residences, from assisted living to nursing homes, sprouting up like weeds.  We Baby Boomers have hit age 65 and the industry knows it.  The Village model is a community approach to aging that provides to its members everything from concierge services to health and wellness programs and social and cultural opportunities.<br />

					<p>The Baby Boom generation has breached the beginning age of retirement at 65.  Born between 1946 and 1964 the Baby Boom totaled nearly 76 million births.  From entering kindergarten to entering the labor force to buying homes (and second homes) and now to retirement, the Baby Boom has impacted every social institution along its aging pathway.  Today, concerns about the financial stability of Social Security, trends in disability, health care costs and the supply of caregivers are all driven by the coming explosion in population over the age of 65.</p>
<p>The ending of the Baby Boom in 1964 was a result of economic expansion, high levels of women’s labor force participation and college enrollment and changing lifestyles.  Fertility rates plummeted ushering in the “Baby Bust”, the Gen X folks, where births fell from 4.2 million per year to only 3.4 million per year.  Communities struggled with what to do with all those elementary school classrooms built to accommodate the Baby Boomers.  This rapid decline in births and size of the following generation continued to keep the attention on the Boomers and their needs.  That focused attention on the Boomers continues today. <a href="http://demographicsgoldmine.com/have-you-been-focusing-on-the-baby-boom-market-all-these-years-three-ways-to-stay-on-top-of-markets#more-323" class="more-link">Read More&rarr;</a></p>

					<p style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 12pt; color: #0f2280;">It’s election season. The focus of the candidates and the pollsters is on the swing states because their demographics involve voters who may still be undecided.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 12pt; color: #0f2280;">When we listen to the polls in those swing states they break down the vote by the demographics.</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 12pt; color: #0f2280;">
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there more young or old? Their interests in education, jobs, health care and retirement are different.<br />
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do they live in rural or urban areas? Preservation of rural community life and dealing with congested urban housing are important.<br />
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the population a dominant minority and has it become more or less diverse?<br />
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there differences among males and females in lifestyle and employment?<br />
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there big income differentials that raise concerns over taxes and job opportunities?</p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 12pt; color: #0f2280;">All of these factors are important in an election and they’re important to your business or organization. Campaign managers are constantly looking at the data. Without data on the demographics and economic and social indicators, campaigns can’t target their message.  Imagine having only one message to deliver to such a diverse nation!</p>
<p><a href="http://demographicsgoldmine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/minoritychange.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-310" title="minoritychange" src="http://demographicsgoldmine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/minoritychange-300x224.png" alt="Census Map of Minority Change" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p style="font-family: tahoma; font-size: 12pt; color: #0f2280;">Are you taking advantage of the data? Basic demographic data that are readily available — if you know where to look — can answer important questions to will help your business grow, understand your client’s needs, and help you target your message.  Without it, you&#8217;re making decisions in the dark.</p>

					<p>The Census Bureau just released a new interactive application that illustrates voting patterns by state.<br />
• Are registrations increasing or decreasing?<br />
• Are people registered but don’t vote?<br />
• What are the differences in voting by age, race, gender, and education?</p>
<p>The application illustrates the results of the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey which interviews about 70,000 households nationwide on their voting experience. You can look at the patterns for your state and the nation for every congressional and presidential election from 1996 to 2010.<a href="http://www.rlsdemographics.com/2012/06/05/who-votes-in-your-state/statevoting/" rel="attachment wp-att-210"><img src="http://www.rlsdemographics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/statevoting-300x218.png" alt="" title="statevoting" width="300" height="218" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-210" /></a></p>
<p>Check it out at: <a href="http://smpbff1.dsd.census.gov/TheDataWeb_HotReport/servlet/HotReportEngineServlet?reportid=767b1387bea22b8d3e8486924a69adcd&amp;emailname=essb@boc&amp;filename=0328_nata.hrmlk" title="Interactive Application" target="_blank">http://smpbff1.dsd.census.gov/TheDataWeb_HotReport/servlet/HotReportEngineServlet?reportid=767b1387bea22b8d3e8486924a69adcd&amp;emailname=essb@boc&amp;filename=0328_nata.hrmlk</a></p>
<p>A couple of things to pay attention to: to see data for a state, click the “See State” link; when a state is selected you get the same national map so scroll down the page for the state specific data.</p>

					<p>Do you have price strategies for determining how much you should charge for your product or service?  I received an interesting question from a business entrepreneur.  “Where can you find buying statistics on what someone will pay for a product by demographic group?”  </p>
<p>That’s a pretty unique request though really important when you are trying to figure out the best how much you should charge for your product.  Maybe people in different age or income groups would be willing to pay more for your product and you don’t want to charge too little.  But if you charge too much you’ll lose your customers.  There’s likely an optimal price point for your product but the problem will be finding some standard data or formula that leads to your unique price strategy.  So how can we approach the question of what people are willing to pay?</p>
<p>First, don’t bother looking for standard Census or consumer buying data for this.  That type of data is much to general and most often provides standard budget expenditures for categories of products like groceries, housing, fuel, restaurants, and so on.  We want to know what people age 30 to 49 will comfortably spend on the custom widgets that we import.</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the first things you need to be clear about is your target market?  Do you know their demographics – age, income, education, type of area they live in?  All those factors can affect demand and price points.  Are we talking about the general national population or the population of your local metro? </li>
<li>Price differences across different cities and states can be important also.  You can find the official Consumer Price Index data for some large local metros from the federal government at <a href="http://www.bls.gov/data/#prices">www.bls.gov/data/#prices</a>. There’s also cost of living data for more local areas at <a href="http://www.coli.org">www.coli.org</a> though this isn’t a free service.  These sources still don’t answer the question of “how much should I charge” or, “what will consumers pay” for a particular product, just what the general price differences are in different areas.  Your best price strategy for determining local costs may just be a window shopping trip through your local stores.  This is likely a good indicator especially when you relate that to the demographic characteristics of the local market.  Are you looking in an upscale area, middle income, or low-income.</li>
<li>Another price strategy is “what would people pay on Amazon”.  Say you’re marketing a tutorial package on how your high school student can improve their SAT scores.  Look on Amazon and search for improving SAT scores.  I found almost 300 results in book, video, and audio formats.  This type of search does two things: gets you to a wide range of similar products and focuses on your target market which is high school students.  And don’t forget to pay attention to the “used price” for your item.  This is often a better indicator of what people are willing to pay.</li>
<li>Finally, if we’re talking about marketing to your specific list or community, then your best option is to go straight to your list and do some split testing to answer the question “how much should I charge?”.  That’s the only way you’ll know for sure how your community of followers will respond to price differences.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Bottom line, external data on buying habits of specific demographics simply may not get you the information you need.  Nothing will substitute for your direct research and testing for your specific target market.  Listening to your customers, whether through direct testing or simply paying attention to what they tell you they want will always be your best information.  When you ask yourself the question “how much should I charge?”, use your price strategy to come up with an answer.</p>

					<p>In 1948 the Annie E. Casey Foundation was established to help build better futures for disadvantaged children in the United States.  Among their many projects and services is the annual publication of the Kids Count Data Book and the on-line system that allows you to explore a variety of demographic and health indicators to monitor child well-being.  You should check it out if your work in any way involves the well-being of children or if you simply are interested in economic, demographic, and health related data.  </p>
<p>The <a href=http://datacenter.kidscount.org> Kids Count Data Center </a> allows for on-line access to state and community level data and allows for comparisons across states. For example, the percent of children without health insurance in 2009 varied from a low of 3 percent in Massachusetts to a high of 17% in both Nevada and Texas.  The percent of children in poverty in 2010 was lowest in the states of New Hampshire (10 percent) and highest in Mississippi at 33 percent.  </p>
<p>Here’s an example of a map you can generate on the Kids Count Data Center site showing the state by state distribution in the rate of children 0 to 17 years old in foster care per 1,000 population in 2009.<br />

Source: The Annie E. Casey Foundation, KIDS COUNT Data Center, datacenter.kidscount.org. </p>
<p>Now it’s not always easy to interpret these differences because of potential variations in how individual state’s foster care programs operate.  However, the Kids Count Data Center does a good job of presenting source information and definitions.  It’s always desirable to do some extra research to make sure you’re not comparing apples to oranges but the Kids Count Data Center is a reliable source of data on the well-being of children and a great resource for anyone monitoring those trends.</p>

					<p>Today the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released their monthly figures on <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/2012/pi1211.htm"> personal income</a> for December.  I think they could use a lesson in making their data understandable to the general public.  I’ve worked with these data for years and still have to read their releases a few times to make sense of the basics.</p>
<p>Personal income includes all types of incomes that individuals can receive: wages and salary from your job(s); interest and dividends from your banking/investment accounts; rental income; self-employment income; and percent transfer income like food stamps and other benefit income.  </p>
<p>So, personal income nationwide went up by about $61 billion between November and December.  Seems like a lot but that’s out of $13.1 TRILLION in total personal income or only 0.5 percent.  Still, that’s a pretty good increase considering the November to December increase was only 0.1 percent. </p>
<p>In addition to personal income, the BEA tracks Personal Consumption Expenditures (sorry, spending) too.  In December, spending was up only 0.1 percent from November which means Americans actually had an increase in disposable income but chose to save it instead of spend it.  Surprising in the holiday season.<br />
<a href="http://www.rlsdemographics.com/2012/01/30/personal-income-statistics-what-do-they-mean/bea_pci/" rel="attachment wp-att-180"><img src="http://www.rlsdemographics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/bea_pci-300x181.png" alt="" title="bea_pci" width="300" height="181" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-180" /></a></p>
<p>You should be feeling better knowing that you have more money in your pocket!  But do you really?  Over the entire year of 2011, income and spending pretty much kept pace with each other.  So that increase in December probably doesn’t feel like it’s putting more income in your pocket.  Besides, unemployment, while falling, remains stubbornly high, state and local governments are holding back and cutting jobs, and housing in many areas of the country is still lagging if not still falling.  </p>
<p>There are some bright spots on the U.S. economic horizon but it&#8217;s still a long climb out of the recession.  We tend to always expect quick fixes to our economic woes but the pervasiveness of the housing decline and financial market debacle means there are NO quick fixes.  </p>

					<p>It’s no secret that the advertising and marketing world are heavy consumers of demographic data and track population statistics.  Knowing who your customer is and implementing segmentation strategies are critical to most businesses.  It’s easy to see how advertisers will pick specific programming for TV or other media advertising based on the demographics of the audience for the show or production.  comScore, a global leader in digital market intelligence data, recently released a report <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Presentations_Whitepapers/2012/Next_Generation_Strategies_for_Advertising_to_Millennials">“Next-Generation Strategies for Advertising to Millennials”</a>.  </p>
<p>As the Baby Boom generation ages, their market needs change with them.  There’s a shift from big houses to small, cars for comfort instead of hauling kids, less need for so many electronic gadgets, and what about making that retirement destination decision.  Advertisers look to unique characteristics of generations to focus their messages and products to the largest groups of consumers.  The Millennials fit that model with an estimated $170 billion in purchasing power.  While a dollar is the same regardless of who spends it, the characteristics of each generation mean those dollars get spent in different ways.  </p>
<p>So, how different are the Millenials?  Advertisers need to answer some key questions: are there common grounds between generations; how effective is television or radio advertising for different age groups; are racial differences important in the use of a particular product or service;  how to maximize use of digital media; and what are the best means of persuasion?  </p>
<p>“Share of Choice” is a term used to indicate the response to advertising where a higher number indicates the ad is more persuasive in moving someone to a purchase decision while a lower number indicates less effectiveness.  This quick graphic from the comScore study shows that TV advertising doesn’t do as well a job of persuasion for younger ages as it does for older ages.<br />
<a href="http://www.rlsdemographics.com/2012/01/26/demographics-and-targeted-marketing/comscore_millenials-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-174"><img src="http://www.rlsdemographics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/comScore_millenials1-300x173.png" alt="" title="comScore_millenials" width="300" height="173" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-174" /></a></p>
<p>The report presents some interesting stats but one thing I find lacking is a description of the data collection itself.  The study reportedly includes more than 500,000 women across all ages yet the graphic presentation of some results are based on less than 100 cases and given only in percentages.  And these are the basis for many of the conclusions about effectiveness of TV versus digital advertising media.  I find it difficult to interpret such results and would be surprised that advertisers are making budget decisions on such few cases.</p>

					<p>Just received a google alert about the release of data from <a href=http://royal.pingdom.com>Pingdom </a> on the growth of the Internet in 2011.  Fascinating data but there’s something missing – it doesn’t report on who we are.  Email usage – huge. Website growth – no stopping it.  Internet usage around the world – the US is big but certainly not the biggest.  The only data reported on demographic characteristics is age – 45 percent of Internet users are under age 25.  </p>
<p>There are 2.1 BILLION, yes billion, Internet users worldwide.  That’s almost one-third of every human being on earth!  But is it really?  How do they count them?  If I access the Internet at my home, and on a different machine at the library, and a different machine at work, and a different machine at school, am I one user or four?  I hate it when data is reported without any information about how it’s derived.  I teach my students to always source their information and talk about how they get it.  </p>
<p>I find it really hard to put these data to use helping clients understand how to effectively use the Internet and reach their ideal customer.  It’s great to know the Internet world is expanding at a rapid pace but I need to know who the users are and how best to reach them.  Guess that’s the price of being a demographer and always wanting more out of the data.  After all, how does anyone know the age of Internet users unless they do a sample survey or rely on Facebook users giving their birth dates?</p>
<p>So much for the griping about more data.  Here’s some of the other interesting stuff coming from Pingdom:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were an estimated 100 billion photos on Facebook by mid-2011 (wonder how they “estimated” it – sorry, can’t help myself).</li>
<li>1 Trillion video playbacks on YouTube – can you imagine the servers required to handle that volume?</li>
<li>82.5 percent of the U.S. audience that viewed video online</li>
<li>800 million Facebook users at the end of 2011</li>
<li>100 million active Twitter users</li>
<li>Asia tops the list of Internet users at almost 925 million.  China is the nation with the largest number of users at 485 million.</li>
<li>Also 600 million fixed (wired) broadband subscriptions worldwide – and even in New York, I can’t get one!</li>
<li>71 percent of worldwide email traffic was spam – can definitely believe that!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.rlsdemographics.com/2012/01/24/the-demographics-of-internet-users-who-are-we/internetusers2011-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-167"><img src="http://www.rlsdemographics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/internetusers20111-300x263.jpg" alt="" title="internetusers2011" width="300" height="263" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-167" /></a><br />
I’m used to a world of demographic data that is location based like the Census.  It’s relatively easy to interpret population numbers for a community or county.  But this new world of Internet and social media use – worldwide – is a completely different animal and has some many different applications in the business world.  </p>
<p>A new horizon to explore!!</p>
