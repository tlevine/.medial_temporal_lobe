  No-one wants to talk about Japan these days.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>The conventional wisdom is that the bloom went off Japans economic
  rose around 1990 and that the utter superiority of <span class=SpellE>neoliberal</span>
  capitalism was vindicated by the strong performance of the American economy
  during the 1990s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore,
  everyone is now convinced that China  whose economy is 1/8 the size of
  Japans  is the rising economic power and therefore the appropriate object
  of attention.</p>

  But Japan is, despite everything, still one of the master keys to
  understanding the future of the world economy, because Japan is the clearest
  case study of why <span class=SpellE>neoliberalism</span> is false.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Simply put, Japan has done almost
  everything wrong by <span class=SpellE>neoliberal</span> standards and yet is
  indisputably the second-richest nation in the world.</p>

  This doesnt mean that <span class=SpellE>neoliberalism</span> is wholly <span
  class=SpellE>meritless</span> as an economic theory or as a development
  strategy, but it does mean that its claim to be the <i>only</i> path to
  prosperity has been empirically falsified.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>Japans economy is highly regulated, centrally-planned by the state,
  and often contemptuous of free markets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

  particularly Americans, from even caring about Japans economic policies, let
  alone learning from them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has been
  encouraged by the Japanese government as a way to get foreigners to stop pressing
  for changes in its neo-mercantilist trade policies.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has been propagated by corporate
  interests who gain from free-trade extremism with respect to Japan.<span

  This is a formidable set of potential liars, equipped with money, technical

  power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Japanese government is
  centralized, elitist, and quite capable of fudging statistics if it wants,
  particularly since there are few Westerners who understand Japanese
  accounting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>National accounting is
  notoriously susceptible to creative accounting anyway, as the world learned
  at the time of the Asian Crisis of 1998.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>So the assumption that the standard published figures about Japans

  Japanese culture puts a premium on maintaining face and other forms of
  polite public presentation that constitute literal falsehoods, or at least
  fictions, so it is a natural instinct for the Japanese to tell the West what
  it wants to hear about Japans economy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>Japans government is heir to a Confucian tradition in which the
  public is told only what the rulers deem it should know.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Journalists and academics, who in America
  or Europe would have challenged its version of the economy by now, are loyal
  collaborators of the system, not its critics. So from a Japanese point of
  view, there is nothing immoral, unusual, or terribly difficult about
  misrepresenting Japans economic performance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>In fact, because it is in the national interest, it would be
  unpatriotic not to.</p>

  </span>For example, the Japanese have understood that the ambition of the

  embodies the desirability for some government direction of the economy

  The lynchpin of the system, politicized capital allocation, probably cannot
  work in a democracy, as it would just result in plants being built in the
  districts of powerful parliamentarians and would not make investments whose
  payoff exceeded one election cycle.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>Naturally, <span class=SpellE>kleptocratic</span> oligarchies wouldnt
  be good at it either; politicized capital allocation is only likely to work
  under highly Platonic systems like the <span class=SpellE>MOF</span>.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And even then, there is no guarantee: power
  still corrupts and one can easily imagine such a system becoming inbred and
  perverse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Japans achievement is an
  empirical fact, not a guarantee to all eternity.</p>
