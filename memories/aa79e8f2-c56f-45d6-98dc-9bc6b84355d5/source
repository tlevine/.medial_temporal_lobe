Welcome to the home of <B>nmh</B>, on savannah.nongnu.org.
<p>
The latest stable of nmh is <b>nmh 1.5</b>. You can 
<a href="http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/nmh/nmh-1.5.tar.gz">download
it from savannah</a>.
<p>
We are pleased to announce the release of <b>nmh 1.5</b> on
June 11<sup>th</sup>, 2012.
<b>Nmh 1.5</b> has a number of bug fixes, new features, and behavior changes.
The release notes (see the <tt>NEWS</tt> file in the distribution) has a
complete list of new features, but here are some highlights:
<ul>
<li><b>comp</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>dist</b> now process all drafts through
    <i>mh-format</i>(5) and now support new command line arguments
    <tt>-from</tt>, <tt>-to</tt>, <tt>-cc</tt>, <tt>-fcc</tt>, and
    <tt>-subject</tt>.
<li><b>Nmh</b>'s idea of the local mailbox is now configurable via a new
    profile entry, <tt>Local-Mailbox</tt>.
<li><b>post</b> now requires a &ldquo;From:&rdquo; header in all message
    that it processes.  All components files have been adjusted to include
    an appropriate &ldquo;From:&rdquo; header by default.  The release
    notes have more information on how this transition will affect users.
<li>The <tt>-attach</tt> option is now the default for send (using the
    header <tt>Nmh-Attachment</tt>) and <tt>-attachformat 1</tt> is the
    default attachment type.
<li>Command editing and filename completion (via readline) is now available
    in <b>whatnow</b>
<li>Support for using an external command to filter the body of a message
    through in <b>mhl</b>.  See <i>mhl</i>(1) for more details, specifically
    the <tt>format</tt> keyword, the <tt>formatproc</tt> entry in
    <i>mh-profile</i>(5), and the <tt>-fmtproc</tt> switch for mhl and repl.
<li>Preliminary support for improved MIME handling when replying to messages.
    Yes, a long requested feature has a solution.  See the release notes
    and <tt>docs/contrib/replyfilter</tt> for more information.
</ul>

<B>nmh</B> (new MH) is a powerful electronic mail handling system.
It was originally based on version 6.8.3 of the MH message system
developed by the RAND Corporation and the University of California.
It is intended to be a (mostly) compatible drop-in replacement for MH.
<br><br>
<B>nmh</B> consists of a collection of fairly simple single-purpose
programs to send, receive, save, retrieve, and manipulate e-mail
messages.  Since <B>nmh</B> is a suite rather than a single monolithic program,
you may freely intersperse <B>nmh</B> commands with other commands at your shell
prompt, or write custom scripts which use these commands in flexible ways.
<br><br>
<B>NOTE:</B> All versions of <B>nmh</B> prior to 1.0.3 (as well as MH) contained
a vulnerability where incoming mail messages with carefully designed MIME
headers could cause the <TT>mhshow</TT> command to execute arbitrary shell code.
Though the authors of <B>nmh</B> are not aware of any exploits of this hole, MH
users and users of older versions of <B>nmh</B> are strongly encouraged to
upgrade to the current version.
