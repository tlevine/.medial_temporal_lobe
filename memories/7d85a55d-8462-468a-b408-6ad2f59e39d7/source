                        knitting is mostly a big mystery, guessed at from fragments 
                        kept in museums around the world. Knitting is made of 
                        wool, silk, and other fibers that decay rapidly, even 
                        under perfect conditions; knitting needles are essentially 
                        sharpened sticks, and hard to identify as knitting needles 
                        beyond a doubt; they could be hair picks, skewers, spindles, 
                        or any of the other zillion uses there are for a sharpened 
                        stick. In the past, when spinning was all by hand and 
                        much more time-consuming, many sweaters that didn't fit 
                        were raveled and re-knit. Yarn wasn't discarded until 
                        it wore out. Add in that not many people in the past thought 
                        to save their everyday items for their descendants, and 
                        there aren't many useful knitted objects left for us to 
                        find, all these years later. Once in a while we get lucky. 
                        The archeological evidence we have is very interesting, 
                        and there are other ways to date things.</span> 
                        <p><span class="bodytext">Linguistically, all evidence 
                          implies that knitting is a fairly recent invention. 
                          There are no ancient legends of knitting like there 
                          are legends of spinning and weaving (remember Arachne? 
                          Ixzaluoh? Nephthys? Amaterasu? Never mind... the numbers 
                          of weaving and spinning gods and mostly goddesses are 
                          legion). There are no ancient gods or goddesses who 
                          knit, no legend of how it was invented or given by the 
                          gods. That lack implies that it is a recent skill, developed 
                          after mythologies were established around the world. 
                          It's a shame, because I think a knitting goddess would 
                          be cool... maybe we could make one up? </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">A quick cruise of the 
                          Oxford Unabridged English Dictionary also reveals 
                          that the term 'to knit' wasn't added to English 
                          until the 1400s. Further poking around will reveal 
                          that any term meaning 'to knit', specifically 
                          make loops with two long, straight needles, wasn't 
                          in any European language before the Renaissance. 
                          Other than the Middle East, and Spain, other places 
                          in the world were even later in their assigning 
                          words for knitting. It's pretty obvious; knitting 
                          hasn't been around that long. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">Most of what we're left with 
                          in terms of physical evidence is a tiny pile of knitted 
                          fragments, and a lot of speculation. And did I mention 
                          the knit fragments are really hard to interpret? Before 
                          the development of knitting, a craft called nalbinding 
                          was used to make stretchy fabrics. (Go <a href="http://polaris.umuc.edu/%7Ejthies/sca/viking/jorviksocks.html" target="new">here</a> 
                          for a quickie lesson on how nalbinding is done. The 
                          drawbacks are obvious immediately.) Termed 'one needle 
                          knitting' by some museums, it is similar to knitting 
                          in structure, but stronger, less stretchy, and a lot 
                          more difficult to create. The resulting fabric would 
                          look very sloppy unless done by a master, and it wasn't 
                          something you could have the kids do while tending the 
                          sheep  --  unlike knitting. </span></p>

                        <p><span class="bodytext">These socks date to the 300s, 
                          and are made by nalbinding. They look very much like 
                          crossed-stitch or twisted-stitch knitting. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">As a fine example of the nalbinding/knitting 
                          confusion, the famous (notorious?) Dura-Europos fragment 
                          is considered by many to be the oldest fragment of knitting 
                          in existence. Found in the Indus River Valley and dating 
                          back several thousand years, it is listed in many books 
                          and the original dig report as knitting (I sincerely 
                          wonder if they HAD a knitter on the original dig.) Barbara 
                          Walker has even written a pattern so we can all knit 
                          something historical. Unfortunately, the Dura-Europos 
                          fragment has been proven to be made of nalbinding. Still, 
                          the knit version would make a cool pair of socks. </span></p>

                          You can see the patterns are already quite complex. 
                          From &quot;Folk Socks&quot; by Nancy Bush, p. 13 and <a

                          page</a>. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">These socks bring me (and more 
                          importantly real, trained archeologists) to a conclusion; 
                          knitting's probably a little older than we think, because 
                          the first fragments we've got are good-looking, well-made, 
                          complex designs. To put it another way, would YOU do 
                          stranded-color socks as your first project, particularly 
                          if you were making it up as you went and had no one 
                          to teach you? With that in mind, given our thousand-year-old 
                          fragments, knitting might be eleven hundred, twelve 
                          hundred years old, allowing for a lifetime or two for 
                          people to invent the methods and then get fancy with 
                          them. It pains my history-obsessed heart to admit it, 
                          but knitting's a recent invention (put against the backdrop 
                          of all of human history, anyway). </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">Among some historians (I won't 
                          name names), there seems to be a lot of, um, denial 
                          going on about where knitting was developed. There is 
                          a fairly obvious trail of artifacts from Egypt to Moorish-occupied 
                          Spain, and up into the rest of Europe. Some rather Eurocentric 
                          types claim this isn't evidence enough to 'prove' that 
                          knitting was invented in the Middle East, so I'll pile 
                          on a few more points in favor of a Middle-Eastern invention 
                          of knitting. Keep in mind we're discussing the Middle 
                          Ages.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">The first dateable hunk of knitting 
                          found in Europe is from Spain (the Spain that was, at 
                          the time, held by Arabic peoples), in a tomb that was 
                          sealed up in 1275, slap in the middle of the darkest 
                          of the Dark Ages. And YET, all of the early knitting 
                          fragments have writing knit into them. Many of the sock 
                          fragments have 'Allah' knit in bands around them, assumed 
                          to function as a blessing. The pillow in Spain has 'blessing' 
                          in a decorative Arabic script knit around the edges. 
                          We can pretty safely assume that knitting words into 
                          knitting was done almost from the first, at a time Europe 
                          was largely illiterate. It was the Islamic world that 
                          had wide-spread literacy. No one's gonna convince me 
                          that an illiterate was the one who came up with the 
                          idea to knit words into a sock. So, the early knitting 
                          fragments were produced by someone literate, and most 
                          literate people were found somewhere in the Islamic 
                          world. Particularly literate people with a knowledge 
                          of decorative Arabic scripts. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">Added to that, for the first 
                          four or five hundred years of knitting's history, the 
                          most common materials were cotton and silk. Not wool. 
                          Cotton and silk were far easier to come by in the Middle 
                          East than in Europe. If knitting had started in Europe, 
                          I imagine they'd have used wool first. Or maybe linen. 
                          </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">My final proof is how we knit. 
                          Ever notice we work the stitches from right to left? 
                          Ever wonder why? We write left to right... doesn't it 
                          follow that we would KNIT left to right? Only if we 
                          invented it in the first place. Arabic is written from 
                          right to left. I'm betting that our current knitting 
                          method is a holdover from that. (We knit right to left 
                          today because some Arabic person started doing it that 
                          way over a thousand years ago. History is so cool.) 
                          </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">So what do we know? Knitting 
                          kind of appeared, poof, probably in Egypt or an adjoining 
                          land, sometime around 1000CE and spread rapidly, moving 
                          along trade routes into Europe. Another theory holds 
                          that knitting was brought back to Europe during the 
                          Crusades (1095-1291), but I can't imagine the Crusaders 
                          taking time off from raping and pillaging to share sock-making 
                          techniques in the Middle East. Call me a cynic. I can't 
                          imagine a bunch of Arabs taking a break from being attacked 
                          to teach some stinky Europeans how to knit, either. 
                          </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">From the 1275 pillow found in 
                          Spain, things fan out in terms of direction, and speed 
                          up. There are 'clumsily made' gloves from France dating 
                          to the 1200s (someone teaching themselves to knit, having 
                          seen a trade good?) Then liturgical gloves in a German 
                          tomb, dated to 1297, similar to the ones found in the 
                          Victoria and Albert Museum: </span></p>

                        <p><span class="bodytext">At this stage, knitting was 
                          still a luxury trade item; it was created from imported 
                          silks and cottons, and made into non-vital things like 
                          pillows, liturgical gloves, and small bags. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">In the 1350s, paintings called 
                          'knitting madonnas' began to appear. They depict the 
                          Virgin Mary knitting; the paintings are detailed enough 
                          to show that SOMEONE in Europe knew how to knit. The 
                          painting thought to be the earliest of them is found 
                          in Northern Italy (not far from Spain, especially if 
                          you think in terms of trade routes). Another knitting 
                          Madonna was painted in Germany around 1400. The knowledge 
                          of how to knit was starting to spread, quickly. </span></p>

                          the mid-1500s, the first and only major new technique 
                          was introduced to knitting: the purl stitch. First found 
                          on a pair of stockings in a tomb in Toledo, Spain, dated 
                          to 1562. Up until then, all those socks had curly edges. 
                          Can you imagine? </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">By the 1500s, most of the wealthy 
                          in Europe had at least one pair of knit socks (these 
                          were the days of shortie trunk hose and loooong socks 
                          for men, remember), and possibly a knit undershirt or 
                          jacket. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="bodytext">In 1566, King Eric of Sweden 
                          had a garment inventory done; he owned twenty-seven 
                          pairs of silk stockings imported from Spain, each pair 
                          costing the same as his valet's ANNUAL salary (What 
                          a clothes horse! He's lucky he didn't have taxpayers 
                          to answer to). </span></p>

                          one pair is 25 stitches and 32 rows PER INCH. Yes, INCH. 
                          This was before the invention of knitting frames or 
                          anything else in terms of automation; these babies were 
                          knit by hand. (For the sake of the knitters, I hope 
                          they were done in direct sunlight, but I'm betting not.

                          jackets and shirts were also popular at this time, usually 
                          knit from silk and gilt threads. (Gilt yarn at the time 
                          was made from actual metal. Can you imagine how fun 
                          THAT was to knit with? It probably tarnished and looked 
                          like crap within the year, too.) Looking at this jacket, 
                          you can see that they were still following woven ideals 
                          for fit and cut. The undershirts are very much like 
                          woven undershirts of the day, something like a modern 
                          Henley, with a longer, flaring shirt tail. Charles the 
                          I of England was said to be wearing one of these undershirts 
                          when he was beheaded in 1649. (Sky blue silk at a gauge 
                          of 8.5 stitches per cm, or about 17 stitches PER INCH.) 
                          Knitting was still pretty exclusive, but not for long. 
                          Economics reared its ugly head, in the form of supply 
                          and demand. </span></p>

                          cottage industries began to appear; a hat-knitting guild 
                          appeared in England in 1424, along with many others 
                          across Europe. Once the common man knew how to knit, 
                          the obvious happened. We started knitting for ourselves. 
                          One of the first of the commonly available knitted products 
                          was the 'acorn hat', made of felted wool. This one dates 
                          to the 1600s. That's right, it took us about five hundred 
                          years to make common 'everyday' knitting out of wool.

                          predictable; the knowledge of knitting spread around 
                          the world, following trade routes. Sailors were big 
                          fans of knitting, since it was small, portable, and 
                          gave them something to do on long voyages. Back in Europe, 
                          the peasants gradually began adding knitting to their 
                          folk costumes, giving us all those lovely ethnic sweaters 
                          we (okay, I) love to knit. </span></p>

                          knitting has shifted regularly, from high-demand luxury 
                          item to low-demand folk craft, and back again. In the 
                          Victorian era, knitting became a parlor art, used to 
                          make all sorts of exquisitely fine laces, bags, and 
                          baby clothes. They seem to be the ones who introduced 
                          fine beadwork to knitting, stringing tiny beads onto 
                          sewing thread and knitting it into fabric. </span></p>

                          was the idea of knitwear as sportswear, coming from 
                          two places at once  --  British royalty and the Paris designers. 
                          The Prince of Wales began wearing Fair Isle sweaters

                          one knows where the original is, if it still exists).

                          mass-produced her 'bow knot' sweater, the crowds went

                        <p><span class="bodytext">In the 1930s, the depression 
                          hit, and around the world, several co-ops were set up 
                          to help women earn money by knitting. The (deservedly) 
                          most famous of these was Bohus Stickning, founded in 
                          Sweden by Emma Jacobsson. The sweaters are still known 
                          among hard-core knitters like myself, as amazing examples 
                          of color and design, proof that with care and attention, 
                          any craft can be made into art. Below is a photo of 
                          one of their most popular designs, the &quot;Blue Shimmer&quot;. 
                          </span></p>

                        <p><span class="bodytext">The thing that made knitting 
                          so immediately popular when it was invented, is what 
                          makes it popular even today: it's simplicity. With two 
                          sticks and some string, you can create literally any 
                          article of clothing (And not only is that simple, it's 
                          pretty darn cool). We occasionally add a new technique, 
                          but for the most part knitting is unchanged from twelve 
                          hundred years ago, when some poor nalbinder dumped their 
                          needle and said 'there has to be a better way'. Knitwear 
                          is as popular as ever, if not more so; people learn 
                          to knit daily, and classes are booming. Scientists have 
                          begun knitting nylon arteries to transplant into bodies, 
                          and metallic shields for hoses. It will be interesting 
                          to see what knitting will do next. </span></p>
