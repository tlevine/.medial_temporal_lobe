<p><h4>About me</h4></p>

<p>I nurture the software community that supports the Wikimedia movement, as <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Sharihareswara_%28WMF%29">Engineering Community Manager at the Wikimedia Foundation</a>; <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Sharihareswara (WMF)">follow my work</a>.  </p>
<p>
More generally, I'm a technology executive and open source management consultant who leads software development (<a href="http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana-harihareswara-resume.txt">my slightly outdated resume</a>). <a 
href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sumanah">I'm on LinkedIn</a>. 

<p><img src="http://www.crummy.com/graphics/people/sumana-protocol.png" align=right
alt="Alert: Sumana is not a registered protocol." /> I live in New York, New York in
the United States of America.  I earned a bachelor's degree in political science at
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">the University of California at Berkeley</a> and a 
master's in technology management at <a
href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, and have worked at 
<a href="http://www.salon.com/">Salon.com</a>, <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">Fog 
Creek Software</a>, <a href="http://www.behaviordesign.com/">Behavior</a>, and <a href="http://www.collabora.co.uk/">Collabora</a>.
</p>

<p>I've kept an online diary, <a href="ces.shtml">Cogito, Ergo Sumana</a>, since late 2000, and <a href="http://identi.ca/brainwane">an identi.ca microblog</a> since mid-2009.  I also co-maintain
<a href="/spam">Spam As Folk Art</a>, a weblog
chronicling the more bizarre and evocative phrases in junk email.</p>

<p>Two web diarists inspired my own journal: my inspiringly philosophical friend <a
href="http://www.loyalty.org/~schoen/"> Seth Schoen</a> (<a
href="http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/">diary</a>) and my astonishingly clever husband,
<a href="http://www.crummy.com/">Leonard Richardson</a>.  For other interesting

<p><h4>Interests and background</h4></p>

<p>My parents hail from Karnataka, a state in southern India, where the native language is Kannada and the
people are Kannadigas. For several years <a

published</a> the Kannada/English magazine <em>Amerikannada</em>, many issues of which now reside in the <a
href="http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b15889371~S1">collections</a> of the University of California at Berkeley.  I was Youth
Editor for the 2001 Kannada Koota Magazine (<a href="kidswriting.txt">my editor's note</a>).</p>
<p>
I was born in New Jersey, and moved through Pennsylvania, Missouri, and northern California before coming to New 
York.  If you think you went to school with me, you probably did.  <a href="http://www.crummy.com/">Leonard 
Richardson</a> and I got married in April of 2006.
</p>
<p>I'm interested in books, careers, good teaching, political science, tax history, 
stand-up comedy and other sorts, Dance Dance Revolution, faith, Russian, Russia, India, 
good cinema, innovation, the cultural/political aspects of technology, project 
management, and so on.
