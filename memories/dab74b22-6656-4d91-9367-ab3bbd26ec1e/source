<h1 align="center">The Second Law of Thermodynamics!</h1>

<h3 align="center"><em><strong>Time's Arrow............................Murphy's 
  Law................................Entropy</strong></em></h3>

<p>&nbsp;<br><span class="dropcap">Q</span>: Who cares about the second law of thermodynamics?<br><span class="dropcap">A</span>: Anyone who wonders how the material world -- our world of energy and matter --works. 
<p><span class="dropcap">Q</span>: Big deal? <br><span class="dropcap">A</span>: The biggest, most powerful, most general idea in all of science. Why paper, 
  trees, coal, gas and all things like them burn (and why people &quot;should&quot; 
  spontaneously catch fire in air), why sand and dry ice even in pure oxygen can't 
  ever burn, why the sun will eventually cool down, why iron rusts (but not why 
  it rusts faster nearer the ocean), why there are hurricanes or any weather at 
  all on earth, what makes things break, why houses get torn apart in tornadoes 
  or explosions, why everything living tends to die. <br>

That's for starters.<p><span class="dropcap">Q</span>: Just STARTERS? OK, OK, I'm impressed. So, what IS the second law of thermodynamics? 
  Well, wait a minute, what's the first law?<br><span class="dropcap">A</span>: The first law is very simple and important but pretty dull: You can't create 
  or destroy energy.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p style="margin-left: 0">You can just change it from one form to another, for 
    example, electricity to heat, heat that will boil water and make steam, hot 
    steam to push a piston (mechanical energy) or rotate a turbine that makes 
    electricity that in turn can be changed to light in a light bulb or to sound 
    in an audio speaker system, and so forth. That's it. Important but dull.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second law of thermodynamics looks mathematically simple 
  but it has so many subtle and complex implications that it makes most chem majors 
  sweat a lot before (and after) they graduate. Fortunately its practical, down-to-earth 
  applications are easy and crystal clear. These are what we'll talk about. From 
  them we'll get to very sophisticated conclusions about how material substances 
  and objects affect our lives.<br>
  <br><span class="dropcap">Q</span>: Sounds fair. I'm listening.<br><span class="dropcap">A</span>: Look at the direction that energy flows in any happening or process or event. 
  That is the first step to understanding what the second law of thermodynamics 
  is and what it applies to. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-left: 0"><font color="#0000FF"><em>Energy spontaneously tends to flow
  only from being concentrated in one place <br>
    to becoming diffused or dispersed and spread out. </em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Later we'll come back to those two tricky words &quot;spontaneously&quot; 
  and &quot;tends&quot;.) That's it, the big idea.&nbsp; The perfect illustration 
  is: A hot frying pan cools down when it is taken off the kitchen stove. Its 
  thermal energy (&quot;heat&quot;) flows out to the cooler room air. The opposite 
  never happens.<p>
  <span class="dropcap">Q</span>: Come on. All this build up for that dumb example? <br><span class="dropcap">A</span>: Don't put me down. I could have snowed you with differential equations and 
  diagrams instead of what you see everyday. We're being practical and visual 
  rather than going the math route, essential as that is in chemistry. <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big deal is that <em>all</em> types of energy spread 
  out like the energy in that hot pan does (unless somehow they're hindered from 
  doing so) They don't tend to stay concentrated in a small space; they flow toward 
  becoming dispersed if they can -- like electricity in a battery or a power line 
  or lightning, wind from a high pressure weather system or air compressed in 
  a tire, all heated objects, loud sounds, water or boulders that are high up 
  on a mountain, your car's kinetic energy when you take your foot off the gas. 
  All these different kinds of energy spread out if there's a way they can do 
  so. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get the picture? The second law of thermodynamics summarizes that totally different 
  events involving all kinds of energy have a common cause. A blowout in a tire 
  or a car battery shorting out or slowly running down -- what could seem to be 
  more unlike than those! Yet the reason for their occurring is the same, the 
  tendency for concentrated energy not to stay localized, to disperse if it has 
  a chance and isn't hindered somehow.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major goal in life is to find true BIG ideas that describe 
  how the world works, to understand why and how things happen around us in terms 
  of a small number of basic principles. Principles that can be tested and checked. 
  You can't do better than the second law of thermodynamics. And the direction 
  of energy flow is just a tip of the iceberg of that law.<p>
  <br>

  <span class="dropcap">Q</span> :  Iceberg? Titanic iceberg?<br>
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>: <a name="time"></a>Come on now. You know that's just a figure of speech to 
  give a feeling for the size of this principle. But... OK, let's get literal: 
  Run that Titanic movie as the ship hits the iceberg. See those steel plates 
  ripped open and the ship begin to sink. Realistic, right? Can you imagine a 
  real happening in which the reverse occurs? A sinking ship whose steel side 
  heals up as it comes up out of the water and floats? Ridiculous. Too stupid 
  to think about. But why is it stupid? Because it is so improbable from your 
  and my experience. Only a movie run backward would show that kind of unrealistic 
  fantasy. The second law isn't some weird scientific idea. It fits with everything 
  common happening that we know.</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin-left: 0"><font color="#0000FF"><em>Our psychological sense of time is
  based on the second law. <br>
  It summarizes what we have seen, what we have experienced, what we think will happen. </em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking ships are like rocks rolling down a mountain -- as they sink, their 
  potential energy due to being high above sea-bottom is diffused, spread out 
  to the water that they push aside (or, in the case of mountain rocks, diffused 
  as they roll down to the valley and hit other rocks, give those a bit of kinetic 
  energy, and warm them slightly by friction.) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a video that is run backward, you may have laughed at some diver
who zooms up from the water to a ten-meter diving board, but you're never fooled that the
video is going forward, i.e., that you are seeing an event as it actually happened in real
time. Unconsciously, you are mentally comparing what you see now with your past practical
experience -- and that has all followed the second law. Even though you may never have
heard of the law before, in the years of your everyday experience you have seen thousands
and thousands of examples of energy flowing from being concentrated to becoming diffused. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A swimmer doesn't come shooting up out of the water to the 
  diving board, rocks in a valley don't suddenly roll up a mountain, outside air 
  doesn't rush into a flat tire, batteries don't get charged by sitting around. 
  <em>Those events all would have energy spontaneously become more concentrated, 
  the opposite of energy spreading out</em>. We sense that videos or movies are 
  shown in the right direction of showing time going forward only if the events 
  in them agree with our lifetime experience about the direction of energy flow: 
  concentrated to dispersed and spread out. The second law points the direction 
  of how we feel time goes.</p>
<p><br><span class="dropcap">Q</span>: So that's why people call the second law &quot;time's arrow&quot;?<br><span class="dropcap">A</span>: You got it. Now let's clear up those tricky words, &quot;spontaneously&quot; 
  and &quot;tends&quot; in the statement of the second law, <em>&quot;Energy spontaneously 
  tends to flow only from being concentrated in one place to becoming diffused 
  and spread out.&quot; </em><br>
  <br><span class="dropcap">Q</span>: Why bother? &quot;Spontaneously&quot; means fast, quick, ad lib .......<br><span class="dropcap">A</span>: Hold it! That may apply to people, but we're talking about how <i>things</i> 
  and chemicals behave. In the second law &quot;spontaneously&quot; means only 
  that any energy which is available in the object or substance for diffusing 
  <i>will</i> spread out from it -- if given a chance. It doesn't have anything 
  to do with how fast or slow that occurs after the dispersal of energy starts, 
  or even when it might start. That's why &quot;tends&quot; is so important to 
  understand as part of the second law. <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The energy available in a hot frying pan or in a loud BOOM 
  from a drum immediately and rapidly begins to spread out to their environments. 
  Nothing hinders that from happening. Lots of ordinary and also unhappy events 
  are like that. But there are an enormous number of &quot;energy diffusing&quot; 
  second-law happenings that are hindered <i>so</i> they don't occur right away. 
  Here's a simple illustration: If I hold a half-pound rock in my fingers so it 
  is ready to fall, it has potential energy concentrated in it because it is up 
  above the ground. If the second law is so great and powerful, why doesn't 
  the energy that has been concentrated in the rock spread out? Obviously, it 
  can't do that because my fingers are &quot;bonding&quot; to it, keeping it from 
  falling. The second law isn't violated. That rock <i>tends</i> to fall and diffuse 
  its energy to the air and to the ground as it hits -- and it <i>will</i> do 
  so <i>spontaneously</i> by itself, without any help -- the second I open my 
  fingers and &quot;unbond&quot; the rock. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="cbon"></a><span class="dropcap">Q</span>: Is that really so important?<br><span class="dropcap">A</span>: Yes, it is. Many philosophers and novelists learned about the second law 
  only from physicists.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, physics emphasizes what happens in a closed or isolated system 
  of tiny particles rather than in our real open-flow world of trees, shiny steel, 
  sunshine, rocks and people, the world of sun energy and things made out of chemicals. 
  Thus, many readers of popular philosophy articles and recent novels have been 
  misled and frightened by talk about the second law as a fast-approaching doomsday. 
  The writers pass too quickly over the fact that it is a <i>tendency</i> rather 
  than a prediction of what will happen right away. </a><br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many real-world chemicals and things the second law can 
  be obstructed or hindered for millions of years. Certainly, the mountains of 
  the world haven't all slid down to sea level in the last several hundred centuries! 
  Similar to my fingers holding the small rock (but millions of times more tightly), 
  even overhanging stone in cliffs or mountains is bonded, chemically bonded, 
  to adjacent atoms in the stone and so the stone can't obey the second law tendency 
  for it to fall to a lower level. Here, as in countless other examples, the second 
  law is blocked by the strength of chemical bonds. It takes a huge number of 
  repetitions of outside energy input like freezing and thawing and earthquakes 
  and windy rainstorms to break the bonds along even a weak bond-line, make a 
  crack, and free particles or pebbles or rocks so they can follow the second 
  law by falling to a lower level. (But even then, they may just fall into a mile-high 
  valley and be kept from dropping any closer to sea level; so here in a different 
  way the second law is further hindered.) <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blockage of the second law is absolutely necessary for us 
  to be alive and happy. Not one of the complex chemical substances in our body 
  and few in the things we enjoy would exist for a microsecond if the second law 
  wasn't obstructed. Its <i>tendency</i> is never eliminated but, fortunately 
  for us, there are a huge number of compounds in which it is blocked for our 
  lifetimes and even far longer.<br>
  <br><span class="dropcap">Q</span>: About time we got to something human. Are we through with rocks?<br><span class="dropcap">A</span>: Yes, but don't forget what they have illustrated. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is helpful to see some of the ways the second 
  law works in the ordinary dusty world of actual objects before looking at its 
  relation to pure substances, the chemicals that make up those objects. Chem 
  profs approach the second law the other way around, starting with atoms and 
  molecules first. And that's certainly OK. Professors rightfully avoid much talk 
  about the behavior of big visible things at all. In the limited time of a chemistry 
  course they can only develop the nature of atoms and molecules and of chemical 
  substances. Objects made from chemicals like a gear or a bridge or a wooden 
  house or a book or a bone just have to be assumed to behave like their constituent 
  substances. What they do because they are big things composed of tiny molecules 
  just has to be left for other courses or our future experience. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll go further to find how the second law affects common objects
and how it is really the mother of all serious Murphy's Laws that apply to things. (We'll
omit the zillions of humorous or stupid variations about the way fallible humans behave,
as well as all the problems surrounding computers and programs!) </p>
