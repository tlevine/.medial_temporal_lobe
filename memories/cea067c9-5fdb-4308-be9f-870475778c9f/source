                    <p class="post-details">Posted on 11. Mar, 2013 by <a href="http://www.therewilding.com/author/admin/" title="Posts by admin" rel="author">admin</a> in <a href="http://www.therewilding.com/blog/" title="View all posts in Blog" rel="category tag">Blog</a></p>
                    
                    <p>I am getting older. Of course, this is true for everyone, but it has arrived for me like an insistent house guest, and I find myself its ambivalent host. For a while, cruising through my late thirties and into my mid-forties, it felt like I was actually getting younger. Each year filled with a sense of youthfulness and discovery. I felt like an innocent, testing out the deep waters after decades of playing in the shallow end. And then it happened. Like something lifted and the reality of my chronology became apparent to me. I realized I am at the door of my Queen years. My own parents gone, and my children now young men preparing to head out into the world on their own, I feel my purpose and my position in the larger lineage of my life shifting radically. I look at babies and feel the grandmother of me tickling at my heart. It feels like such an organic transpiration. I’m definitely ready. But what has become apparent to me here is that there is no turning back. That’s always true for all of us, but up to a certain point, we are not oriented to this awareness. We aren’t supposed to be. Here, it has occurred to me that I am closer to my death than I am to my birth. That the ground beneath me is shifting in exactly the appropriate ways based on this immutable fact. But here, there is so much I don’t know. In the absence of knowing, I miss my mother deeply. Who are my guides?</p>
<div id="attachment_2000" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 207px"><a href="http://aleahchapin.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=34482&amp;Akey=6R4J7T2G"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2000  " title="OlderWomanNude" src="http://www.therewilding.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OlderWomanNude-197x300.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aleah Chapin&#8217;s award-winning portrait of a life-long friend, &#8220;In her, I see the personification of strength through an unguarded and accepting presence.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Without making a conscious decision to do so, about five years ago I began seeking out women elders. I stopped studying with men and began fervently seeking the grandmothers. I went to pray with the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers. I spent a torrentially rainy autumn week with Joanna Macy. Each time I sat almost motionless, watching every movement, every impulse, every breath of these gorgeous old ladies! <em>What were they doing? How were they doing it? What was moving them? What are they afraid of? What are they now fearless about?</em> In my daily life, I am hungrily drawn to the distinct energy of the elder women all around me who are navigating this terrain. Immersing myself in this deceptively deep though heartbreakingly stealth stream, it feels like I’m hydrating a parched patch of my own land. Land that has been condemned as uninhabitable by my culture.</p>
<p>We live in a culture which is terrified of age, a culture nearly devoid of significantly present and respected female elders &#8211; who are owning their elderhood. I look around to find that too many of my elder sisters have learned how to play this game &#8211; staying one step ahead of the fierce but beautiful aging process with chemicals, surgery and clothing that doesn’t honor the shape and needs of our aging bodies. Imagining there is some new-world nobility in learning how to navigate this maze of externally dictated (and unnatural) expectations for how we should look, basing our worth on our ability to stay youthfully appealing, sometimes I feel like I’m walking among traitors. Here my heart breaks as I watch too many of my elder sisters avoiding &#8211; at all costs &#8211; the possibility that we would own our age and our wisdom and become intimidating to the uninitiated. That perhaps now is when we are meant to stop caring whether we are found attractive by other humans, allowing ourselves to answer to something much greater, like the final question &#8211; did we lead relevant lives as fierce lovers and servants of this world? Did we hone our skills as love makers, body and soul, in this lifetime, finding an ever-bolder beautifully unapologetic expression of our gratitude and longing? And did we trust that here, in this place, we would become the most beautiful version of ourselves?</p>
<p>What do the real bodies and faces of women look like who are fierce lovers and servants of this world? What does it look like to embrace that with each new level of wisdom comes a new wrinkle, an ache in our bones, a necessary slowing down and a deeper conversation with Death?</p>
<p>Recently I noticed the pictures of me don’t align with my image of myself. That I’m still imagining the me of my early forties. I looked at a photograph<a href="http://www.therewilding.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/CP_PlazaBlanca20131.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1996" title="CP_PlazaBlanca2013" src="http://www.therewilding.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/CP_PlazaBlanca20131-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /></a> the Earthquake Man just took of me in the desert and didn’t recognize myself. I wanted to turn away. I said, “That photograph scares me. I see an old woman.” He said, without any response other than a perfunctory one, “Hmm. That’s not what I see. I see a beautiful woman.”</p>
<p>I am determined not to make an enemy of my age. It comes with deep grief. How could I ever say I’m done with this world, ready to depart it’s cottonwoods and finches, the sweet breath of my children and their children, the sunsets and autumn’s last strawberries? Well, it’s perfect that I end with that, because autumn’s last strawberries have the most complex flavor, filled with the innocence of spring and sharpened with the warning of first frosts and the last-gasp-give-it-everything-you’ve-got burst of no-going-back.</p>
<p>I know, at 47 I’m a long way from this moment. But I crossed a threshold recently, realizing that my job as a woman is shifting. My definition of beauty being refined and deepened and the need for my sense-of-self to answer to a much greater reflection of my own worth and purpose. I am afraid here, finding my way by looking within and back as much as I continue to look forward.</p>

        <p>Beautiful&#8230; and timely. Women (men too) are beautiful when they let go of that struggle of youth. These thoughts have been with me for a couple of years and when the first Social Security check came turning the corner to a new chapter sunk in.</p>

        <p>I loved this article for many reasons. First the writing was entangling from the first sentence.  More, the topic was gender less in many ways.  The reason I love aging so much is what I am willing to let go of in order to get a grip on what is important.  Aging is liberation to and for me.</p>

        <p>When I was 14 I was blessed to overhear an interview with an aging Hollywood actress of the black and white and silverscreen era answer the question, &#8220;Why with all your money have you not considered plastic surgery along with your peers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her answer had so much dignity I decided then and there that she was the one I hoped to emulate as I too aged&#8230;she said</p>

        <p>As a child I loved older women, especially my 90+ year old grandma. I saw love in her face, and I associated love with age.</p>
<p>So I believed that as a woman aged, she got LOVElier. And that is what has happened to my life: it has become lovelier.</p>
<p>When I was approaching 50 I was full of delight. I wanted to celebrate my 50th birthday like no other. I learned to belly dance, and performed with my new belly dance troupe at my birthday. Belly dancing makes my body sing.</p>
<p>I live my live in the present, and as much as possible do only what make my heart sing. I love who I am, love transformation. I love helping other women awaken to their own self-love though body work: Craniosacral Therapy, Reiki, massage, and more.</p>
<p>I love to be in nature, to play with my old rescued great Pyrenees.</p>
<p>As for the wrinkles, they are the result of my life well lived. I really enjoy seeing my smile lines. At the same time, I use a lovely night treatment cream that reduces them considerably. People say I look much younger than 62.5. I am happy to share this with anyone, but this is not the place to promote anything but enjoying your life.</p>
<p>So, how are you going to enjoy who you are today? How will your heart sing today?</p>

        <p>It is such a pleasure to read this essay. Thank you so much. As a woman, soon to turn 65, I find myself thinking along very similar lines. Your words are so eloquent&#8230;&#8221;&#8230;allowing ourselves to answer to something much greater, like the final question – did we lead relevant lives as fierce lovers and servants of this world? Did we hone our skills as love makers, body and soul, in this lifetime, finding an ever-bolder beautifully unapologetic expression of our gratitude and longing? And did we trust that here, in this place, we would become the most beautiful version of ourselves?&#8221; This is the discussion I am having with my two older sisters knowing we are three examples for our five younger sisters and all our daughters and granddaughters. I love the last sentence in the part I&#8217;ve quoted. Your beautiful version is shining! Thank you from my heart.</p>

        <p>You wonder where to find guidance&#8211;perhaps they come alive within us as we awaken to their presence. Some are not all wisdom, some carry that wound that passed down through the generations to be placed upon your shoulders. It is up to you to hold that longlost ancestor in your heart and say, You are loved. You are forgiven. You are free.</p>

        <p>Dear Christine,</p>
<p>Thank you for such a beautiful soul searching and such an honesty about aging.  Each of us finds our own way. I loved your exploration of the variations in appearance, acceptance of aging in all its varieties.  I was surprised to eventually read that you are only 47 years old.  For me that is young. I am 70 years old. I worked in corporate life until 58, when managers talked about hiring young talent. It was my time to leave. At first, it took a while to grasp that this was a major change.  The physical disabilities I had ignored when I was working were now rearing their ugly head. However, I turned things on their heads, and celebrated my 60th birthday with a very comfortable group of old friends, ate delicious French food and drank wine. FOr my 70th birthday, and expanded group of friends enjoyed Italian ford and wine this time.  People I knew in the past were astonished how much better I looked after corporate life. I get more compliments for my white hair than I ever got for the various colors I wore in the past. It is a new life, exploring creative aspects, making new friendships.  I am not as honest as you are, about bones and body, and only talk to close friends about the bumps and lumps and stitches from head to toe, and we then we just laugh! All of a sudden, within one year, I feel as if the aging had grown Mercury&#8217;s feet!  But the truth of it all, is that we spend more time thinking about books we read, writing classes and even exercize that only started at 60.  </p>
<p>Still thinking of the beauty of your article. It has such a richness in spiritually that allows you to touch every aspect of your body.  Thank you so much for writing such a beautiful piece.</p>
<p>Sarah</p>
<p>collaging cigar boxes, and planning to be a volunteer soon. Other great joys are music and great movies.</p>

        <p>At last !!! A woman seeing and seeking what I am. A call to all of us over 50 who wonder who we are, where we&#8217;re going, and how we&#8217;ll hold ourselves on the journey. Any women looking to explore this topic is a friend I&#8217;d like to know. And may I say the spiritual component of the aging process is a lovely unfolding of understanding of both the big and small parts of the road of life. Hallelujah to all of us making this journey now and may we all meet up in some way soon.</p>

        <p>Namaste&#8217;, and thank you so very, VERY much for this wonderful article.  It couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time as, and 48yrs old, I was just diagnosed with menopause, something that i&#8217;m wrestling with to accept, and make peace with.  As I have no children of my own, I&#8217;ve never felt like i&#8217;ve &#8216;grown up&#8217; to be my calendar age, so to be a Crone, just blows my mind.  How the hell did this happen to ME, and it&#8217;s so not possible, as I still climb trees, and enjoy a good mud fight like the kids I enjoy playing with?!  Sigh.  It is what it is, and I know I have to somehow figure out how to embrace this season of my life, and find the beauty in it.  Afterall, as you so beautifully stated, I have earned it, even if i&#8217;m surprised by the timing of it.  Blessings to you, and again-Thank you.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the article and thank you to everyone for all your insights. I love the comments relating to celebrating our age as a mark of having lived! &#8230;And not just that, but being grateful for having lived this long. (I turn 57 in a few months..and have always imagined I will make it to 100!).I also loved the notions that growing older can be a liberating and  &#8216;growing&#8217; experience&#8230; (ie emotional learning from past &#8216;injuries&#8217; &amp; experiences and the recognition that everything in life is a &#8216;gift&#8217;). I am learning now to live in the present and live it passionately! My love goes out to you all <img src='http://www.therewilding.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

        <p>LOVE THIS!! I must tell you that the picture reminds me of my grandmother. We shared a bedroom when I was growing up. I watched her get dressed everyday and thought her body was just normal. I also had a great aunt who spent time with me all through my childhood. I loved these older, wise women with their wrinkles, thick glasses, and saggy boobs. They always had time for me. They took me to the movies, the beach,the park and the &#8220;City&#8221; (NYC, that is). I enjoyed sitting at the kitchen table and listening to their stories as they drank a Manhattan or &#8220;high ball.&#8221; I am not afraid of aging as I had great role models. However, I prefer a glass of red wine.</p>

        <p>I enjoyed your article as much as all the other women and men written above here. HOWEVER, if I hadn&#8217;t been so vain and wanted a face lift, I&#8217;d never have found out I had lung cancer! So, now I&#8217;m on a New Avenue of life for however long it will last. I&#8217;m not afraid and I still go about my life mostly in the same way as before. After two lung sugaries (as my niece calls it), I&#8217;ve changed my mind about the face lift. Just got my bicycle tuned up and ready for Spring and looking forward to a June holiday week with the Over-The-Hill Meet Up on Hateras Island and Ocracoke, NC. I&#8217;m not finished Yet!!!</p>

        <p>&#8220;align with the image of myself&#8221;.  THat is a hard one.  I realized just today that when I look in the mirror I make sure the angle is such that it favors me, that I smile, and like the way that I look.  But when I candidly catch a glimpse in a window, or a car mirror, or see a photograph I was not posing for, I see an old lady.  Who am I?  I don&#8217;t feel old.  I am a full time college student and hang out with kids, and most of the time think I am one of them.  Then I see the mirror.  It is something I don&#8217;t yet know how to reckon with.</p>

        <p>I don´t know what &#8220;getting older&#8221; means, except that I am free from the idea that I need to please everyone. On my 50th birthday, I was all-terrain roller skating in the old quarter of town with a friend. Dinner at a charming sidewalk cafe was accompanied by the comment of our waiter: &#8220;Here I am tired at 26, and you´re skating on your 50th!&#8221; I´m vegan, and have been vegan or vegetarian for 31 years, which keeps me much younger than my &#8220;age&#8221;. A lot of people look to me for advice, my 13-year-old daughter most of all. Every day looks like a fresh opportunity to me. Explain &#8220;getting old&#8221; to me, as that is a foreign concept.</p>

        <p>Thank YOU for writing this! It touched and moved me.  I feel like I&#8217;m on the precipice of grand new adventure that&#8217;s scary and exhilarating at the same time.  Many fellow SiStars my age (I&#8217;m 45) are hanging on to their youth with clawing fingers.  I&#8217;m trying to age naturally so I feel quite the lone wolf.  I figure what better example for my daughter to show her it&#8217;s okay to accept the changes that come along as one moves through life.  Thank you again!!</p>

        <p>I am nearly 60 and fit , but I ask myself should I worry so much about my wrinkles dying my hair and bulges in my figure ?&#8230;it was easy when I was young but each day it&#8217;s harder to keep in shape and work.  Also to find the energy and mindset to think of the bladder problems and accumulating fat in the wrong places , the eyesight fading, facial hair etc etc.</p>
<p>I just want to be me but peer pressure from friends who have facelifts do workouts everyday join clubs and seem to be so savvy&#8230;..it just gets in the way. Talk about young women peer pressure older women these day have it also !</p>
<p>Thanks for the insight as we all get too caught up in &#8220;beautiful&#8221;.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much, as you have put into words exactly as I have been feeling, in this my 73rd year&#8230;so I guess thats not so bad, I feel (In my mind) that I am still in my 50s but when I look in the mirror, I see with different eyes.<br />
I still imagine that I can do everything that I used to do&#8230;but the body resists&#8230;I must say that despite all that, I am happier than I have every been, I am wiser now and I know that forgiveness and acceptance is the answer to most of the things that hurt us (it is usually a lesson in life)<br />

        <p>Wonderful text!  I&#8217;m 48 years old and I&#8217;m passing by the same reflexion.  I shaved my hairs 2 years ago to raise money for children fighting cancer.  Since then, I didn&#8217;t dye my hair. They are the same colour as yours.  I&#8217;m telling myself if more women dare to show themselves as they are, more women didn&#8217;t have to feel they have to keep the beauty standards as high.</p>
<p>Natural is beautiful. Why don&#8217;t accept ourselves as we are: not perfect but unique.</p>

        <p>Again, you&#8217;ve captured so eloquently my similar thoughts about again and eldership.  As a man of 61, I look around and see such beauty and wisdom in those wrinkled faces of my male and female elders.  I love elders who know the gift of grace.  Elders whose eyes may not see things clearly; but see a clarity that youth can not yet.  I love the elders whose shoulder sink a bit as they&#8217;ve carried burdens (some of mine too) over years and did it with love.  Their hearing may not be as good, but they can listen and hear things that others can&#8217;t&#8230;like the hidden grief in another&#8217;s heart. The wrinkles hold secrets and teachings.  I&#8217;m grateful for those elders who forget a name or a face, but remember what is really important.  There is a place for elders, I think they are the medicine we need to wake up.</p>

            	<h3>What To Remember When Waking</h3>
                <p>To be human
<br>is to become visible
<br>while carrying what is hidden
<br>as a gift to others.
<br>
<br>To remember the other world
<br>in <em>this</em> world
<br>is to live in your
<br>true inheritance.
