    <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/paestheticsllc">The Silent Barn</a> is a multi-functional all-ages art incubation space in an outer borough of New York City. <br>
    It operates a daily all-ages events venue, facilitating music, performing arts, and other events; <br>
    it acts as an experimental sandbox for a wide variety of social and interactive projects; <br>
    and it hosts a residency program for artists of all ages who may benefit from living directly <br>
    at the center of public art and performance activity. <p>
    The Silent Barn is the living body of a whirlwind of symbiotic relationships between events, <br> interactive installations, residents, and audience that simultaneously make the Silent Barn their home.  <br> Performance programs and other event programs at the Silent Barn bring a daily stream of exposure, <br>
    discussion, feedback, and organic growth of experimental community projects.   <br>
    The presence of these openly interactive projects cultivate a healthy and curious audience, <br>
    and make the Silent Barn a continuously evolving and uniquely multi-functional event space for performing artists.  <br> 
    The residents of the Silent Barn share their living and kitchen space with these performances
    and art projects, <br> 
    extending a chamber music like intimacy and feeling of welcome to both performers and audience members, <br>
    and encouraging a level of accessibility to art that can be life-changing to an all-ages community. <br>  The residency program also subsidizes the building operational costs, <br>
    enabling event and art program curators the financial freedom to pioneer unexplored currents in art. <br> <br>

    For the next 10 years at a minimum, the Silent Barn aims to continue providing a safe, all-ages petri dish <br>
    in which to culture art, performance, community, residence, curation, and science experiments. <br> <br>
