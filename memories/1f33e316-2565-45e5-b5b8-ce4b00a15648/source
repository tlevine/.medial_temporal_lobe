<h4>FOIA Update
<br>Vol. VIII, No. 1<br>
1987</h4>
<h2><CENTER>New Fee Waiver Policy Guidance</center></h2>


<P><b>[The following is the full text of the Department of Justice fee
waiver policy guidance memorandum issued to the heads of all federal agencies
on April 2, 1987, by Stephen J. Markman, Assistant Attorney General, Office
of Legal Policy.]</b>

<P>Under the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570,
<nobr>&sect;&sect; 1801-1804,</nobr> 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-48 (1986), all federal agencies
subject to the Freedom of Information Act (&quot;FOIA&quot;) are required to promulgate
revised regulations implementing the FOIA's amended fee and fee waiver
provisions. The Office of Management and Budget has prepared Uniform Freedom
 of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines (&quot;OMB Fee Guidelines&quot;),
52 Fed. Reg. 10011 (March 27, 1987), and the revised FOIA fee regulations
issued by each agency must conform with the OMB Fee Guidelines.

<P>One provision of the Freedom of Information Reform Act requires that
individual agency regulations set forth &quot;procedures and guidelines for
determining when such fees should be waived or reduced.&quot; 5 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect;
552(a)(4)(A)(i)</nobr> (effective April 25, 1987). The OMB Fee Guidelines address
neither this requirement nor the new statutory standard governing the waiver
of FOIA fees, 5 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect; 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).</nobr>

<P>To assist agencies in implementing this provision, and in accordance
with the statutory responsibility of the Department of Justice to encourage
agency compliance with the FOIA, <em>see</em> 5 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect; 552(e),</nobr> I am
providing the following advisory fee waiver policy guidance to all federal
agencies on behalf of the Attorney General, <em>see</em> 28 C.F.R. <nobr>&sect;
0.23(c)</nobr> (1986). <SUP><A HREF="#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP>

<P>The Department of Justice stands committed to encouraging agencies to
waive fees under the FOIA whenever the statutory fee waiver standard is
met. By the same token, of course, agencies also are expected to respect
the balance drawn in the statute, safeguarding federal funds by granting
waivers or reductions only where it is determined that the statutory standard
is satisfied.

<P>This guidance advises agencies of the factors which should be considered
in applying the new statutory fee waiver standard. As the Supreme Court
has made clear in interpreting the FOIA, the Act is to be applied according
to &quot;[t]he plain language of the statute itself.&quot; <SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP>
Part I of this memorandum addresses the new statutory fee and fee waiver
structure, Part II sets forth specific fee waiver factors recommended for
each agency to include in its revised FOIA regulations, and Part III explains
the derivation and application of those factors under the language of the
new statutory fee waiver standard.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I. NEW STATUTORY FEE WAIVER STANDARD</B>

<P>Prior to its amendment in 1986, the FOIA provided for the charging of
fees for document search and duplication, and further provided that such
fees should be waived or reduced wherever that was found to be &quot;in the
public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as
primarily benefiting the general public.&quot; 5 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect; 552(a)(4)(A)</nobr>
(1982).

<P>As amended, effective April 25, 1987, the FOIA establishes three levels
of fees that may be charged: Depending on the identity of the requester
and his use of requested information, 5 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect; 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)</nobr>
provides for the charging of fees for document duplication alone for certain
categories of requesters; fees for search time and duplication, and for
review time as well, in the case of commercial requesters; and, for all
other requesters, fees for search time and duplication. A separate provision
of the amended FOIA provides for the waiver or reduction of applicable
fees upon the satisfaction of a revised statutory fee waiver standard.

<P>The FOIA's new fee waiver standard, found at 5 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect; 552(a)(4)(A)(iii),</nobr>
more specifically defines the term &quot;public interest&quot; and provides:
</p>

<blockquote>Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced
below the fees established under clause (ii) if disclosure of the information
is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly
to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government
and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
</blockquote>

<P>This new statutory fee waiver standard thus sets forth two basic requirements,
both of which must be satisfied before fees properly assessable can be
waived or reduced. <SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3)</A></SUP> First, it must be
established that &quot;disclosure of the [requested] information is in the public
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding
of the operations or activities of the government.&quot; Second, it must be
established that &quot;disclosure of the information <nobr>. . . </nobr>is not primarily
in the commercial interest of the requester.&quot;

<P>Where these two statutory requirements are satisfied, based upon information
supplied by a requester or otherwise made known to an agency, the waiver
or reduction of a FOIA fee is compelled by the statute and should be granted
freely and promptly by the agency. <SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP> Where
one or both of these requirements is not satisfied, a fee waiver is not
warranted under the statute.
</p>


<P><B>II. SUMMARY OF FEE WAIVER GUIDANCE</B>

<P>The Department of Justice recommends that each federal agency employ
the following six factors when, as required by the Freedom of Information
Reform Act, it revises its regulations to set forth &quot;guidelines for determining
when [FOIA] fees should be waived or reduced.&quot; The remainder of this guidance
memorandum elaborates upon the derivation and application of these factors.
In summary, these factors are as follows:

<P>A. Disclosure of the Information &quot;is in the Public Interest Because
it is Likely to Contribute Significantly to Public Understanding of
the Operations or Activities of the Government.&quot;</p>

<dd>(1) <B>The subject of the request:</B> Whether the subject of the requested
records concerns &quot;the operations or activities of the government&quot;;<br><br>

<dd>(2) <B>The informative value of the information to be disclosed:</B>
Whether the disclosure is &quot;likely to contribute&quot; to an understanding of
government operations or activities;<br><br>

<dd>(3) <B>The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general
public likely to result from disclosure:</B> Whether disclosure of the
requested information will contribute to &quot;public understanding&quot;; and<br><br>

<dd>(4) <B>The significance of the contribution to public understanding:</B>
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute &quot;significantly&quot; to public
understanding of government operations or activities.

<P>B. Disclosure of the Information &quot;is Not Primarily in the Commercial
Interest of the Requester.&quot;</p>

<dd>(1) <B>The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest:</B> Whether
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the
requested disclosure; and, if so<br><br>

<dd>(2) <B>The primary interest in disclosure:</B> Whether the magnitude
of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently
large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure
is &quot;primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.&quot;<br>

<P><B>III. APPLICATION OF FEE WAIVER FACTORS</B>

<P>The six enumerated factors elaborated upon below are those which the
new statutory standard, by its plain language, requires agencies to take
into consideration in determining whether the two basic requirements for
a fee waiver or reduction are met. They should be applied to fee waiver
requests sequentially, on a case-by-case basis.

<P>A. Disclosure of the Information &quot;is in the Public Interest Because
it is Likely to Contribute Significantly to Public Understanding of
the Operations or Activities of the Government.&quot;

<P>This first part of the new statutory fee waiver standard sets forth
a specific definition of the crucial term &quot;public interest.&quot; As distinguished
from the previous statutory language, which spoke only generally of a disclosure's
benefit to the public, this language specifies the public benefit resulting
from disclosure to be considered in making fee waiver determinations. In
so doing, it establishes a more particular &quot;public interest&quot; standard to
be met as a threshold matter, with the result that some disclosures that
might have met the more general public interest standard under the previous
standard will not satisfy the standard as revised.

<P>The plain language of this first basic requirement encompasses four
related considerations. A careful analysis of them, in sequence, is necessary
to lead to a proper determination of whether a request satisfies the statute's
specific &quot;public interest&quot; requirement.</p>

<dd>(1) <B>The Subject of the Request:</B> Whether the Subject of the Requested
Records Concerns &quot;the Operations or Activities of the Government.&quot;

<P>Initially, an agency should consider whether the subject of the requested
records, in the context of the request, concerns the operations or activities
of the government in the first place. A more general public interest in
the subject of a record, which was the broader focus of the previous statutory
standard, no longer is sufficient. Rather, the subject matter of the requested
records must specifically concern identifiable operations or activities
of the federal government -- with a connection between them that is direct
and clear, not remote or attenuated. As the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals
recently indicated in applying the predecessor fee waiver standard, &quot;the
links between furnishing the requested information and benefiting the general
public&quot; should not be &quot;tangential,&quot; &quot;less than obvious,&quot; or &quot;at best tenuous.&quot;
<em>National Treasury Employees Union v. Griffin</em>, 811 F.2d 644, 647-48
(D.C. Cir. 1987); <em>see also American Federation of Government
Employees v. Department of Commerce</em>, 632 F. Supp. 1272, 1278 (D.D.C.
1986) (claims of public benefit under previous standard rejected as &quot;too
ephemeral&quot;).

<P>While in most cases records possessed by a federal agency will likely
meet this threshold, there are cases in which requested records do not
directly concern government operations or activities and therefore would
fail to meet it. A prime example can be records in an agency's possession
that were generated by a non-government entity, records which often are
sought for their intrinsic informational content alone. Where requesters
manifestly seek records for their intrinsic content apart from their informative
value with respect to specific government operations or activities, they
can hardly hold real prospect for contributing to public understanding
of those operations or activities. In the case of such requests, whether
for records submitted to an agency or generated by it, this threshold consideration
is not satisfied.</p>

<dd>(2) <B>The Informative Value of the Information to be Disclosed: </B>Whether
the Disclosure is &quot;Likely to Contribute&quot; to an Understanding of Government
Operations or Activities.

<P>Next, an agency should determine whether the disclosure in question
is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or
activities. This requires an analysis of the substantive content of the
disclosable portions of the records requested, in order to determine whether
their disclosure will in fact be informative regarding the particular government
activities or operations that are connected to the subject matter of the
request. The agency to whose operations the records pertain ordinarily
is in the best position to make this determination.

<P>Although the subject matter of a FOIA request may directly concern certain
government operations or activities, if the records (or record portions)
which can be released in response to that request contain nothing that
is meaningfully informative on such operations or activities, then the
requested FOIA disclosure would not at all contribute to an understanding
of them. Further, even where information is meaningful in and of itself,
it does not necessarily hold great potential for contributing to increased
public understanding. Thus, the foundation for a proper fee waiver analysis
must be a close appraisal of the particular information that is to be disclosed,
with careful attention to the potential that it holds for contributing
to the public understanding of government operations or activities.

<P>In this connection, an agency should also consider whether the requested
information is already in the public domain, either in a duplicative or
a substantially identical form. If it is, then disclosure of the information
would not be likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations
or activities, as nothing new would be added to the public record. This
principle properly applied under the previous statutory fee waiver standard,
<em>see, e.g., Blakey v. Department of Justice</em>, 549 F.
Supp. 362, 364-65 (D.D.C. 1982), <em>aff'd mem.</em>, 720 F.2d 215
(D.C. Cir. 1983), and should continue to be applicable.</p>

<dd>(3) <B>The Contribution to an Understanding of the Subject by
the Public Likely to Result from Disclosure:</B> Whether Disclosure
of the Requested Information Will Contribute to &quot;Public Understanding.&quot;

<P>An agency next should consider whether disclosure will contribute to
the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual
understanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons.
<em>See Crooker v. Department of the Army</em>, 577 F. Supp. 1220,
1223 (D.D.C. 1984) (rejecting fee waiver under previous standard for information
of interest to &quot;a small segment of the scientific community,&quot; which would
not &quot;benefit the public at large&quot;), <em>appeal dismissed as
frivolous</em>, No. 84-5089 (D.C. Cir. June 22, 1984).

<P>The proper focus thus must be on the contribution to public understanding,
rather than personal benefit to be derived by the requester. <em>See
National Treasury Employees Union v. Griffin</em>, 811 F.2d at 648 (rejecting
&quot;union's suggestion that its size insures that any benefit to it amounts
to a public benefit&quot;). Thus, a requester's indigency, for example, does
not entitle him to a fee waiver; there must be a credible showing of a
contribution to the public's understanding that would result from disclosure.
<em>Cf. Ely v. United States Postal Service</em>, 753 F.2d 163, 165
(D.C. Cir.) (holding under previous fee waiver standard that indigency
alone did not satisfy statutory requirement that disclosure must primarily
benefit general public), <em>cert. denied</em>, 471 U.S. 1106 (1985).
This is only appropriate, given that a fee waiver necessarily involves
the &quot;expenditure of public funds.&quot; <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also Burriss
v. CIA</em>, 524 F. Supp. 448, 449 (M.D. Tenn. 1981) (&quot;[I]n simple terms,
the public should not foot the bill unless it will be the primary beneficiary
of the [disclosure].&quot;).

<P>For purposes of this analysis, the identity of the requester should
be considered, in order for an agency to determine whether the requester
is in a position to contribute to public understanding through the requested
disclosure. A requester's identity and qualifications -- <em>e.g.</em>, expertise
in the subject area and ability and intention to disseminate the information
to the general public -- should be evaluated. <em>Accord Eudey v.
CIA</em>, 478 F. Supp. 1175, 1177 (D.D.C. 1979) (articulating such approach
under previous fee waiver standard). Specialized knowledge often is required
to extract, synthesize and effectively convey information to the public
and requesters vary in their ability to do so. Where not readily apparent
to an agency, requesters should be asked to describe specifically their
qualifications, the nature of their research, the purposes for which they
intend to use the requested information, and their intended means of dissemination
to the public.

<P>Bare assertions by requesters that they are &quot;researchers&quot; or have &quot;plans
to author a book&quot; are insufficient evidence that a contribution to understanding
by the general public will ultimately result from a disclosure. <em>See
Burriss v. CIA</em>, 524 F. Supp. at 449 (holding such assertions insufficient
under prior law to establish that general public would be ultimate beneficiary
of disclosure). It reasonably may be presumed, however, that those &quot;representatives
of the news media,&quot; as defined in the OMB Fee Guidelines, <SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP>
who have access to the means of public dissemination, readily will be able
to satisfy this aspect of the statutory requirement. <em>Accord FOIA
Update</em>, Fall 1983, at 14.

<P>This consideration is not satisfied simply because a fee waiver request
is made by a library or other record repository, or a requester who intends
merely to disseminate information to such an institution. Such requests,
like those of other requesters, should be analyzed to identify a particular
person who will actually use the requested information in scholarly or
other analytic work and then disseminate it to the general public; absent
that, it cannot be determined that disclosure to the requester will contribute
to the public's understanding of government operations or activities. <em>Accord
National Treasury Employees Union v. Griffin</em>, 811 F.2d at 647 (observing
under previous standard that public benefit should be &quot;identified with
reasonable specificity&quot;). Thus, such requesters should make the same fee
waiver showing that a person would have to make to obtain a fee waiver
directly, including a representation by that person of intent to perform
the work involved.</p>

<dd>(4) <B>The Significance of the Contribution to Public Understanding:</B>
Whether the Contribution to Public Understanding of Government Operations
or Activities Will be &quot;Significant.&quot;

<P>Lastly, an agency is required by the statute to determine whether an
identified contribution to public understanding of government operations
or activities will be a &quot;significant&quot; one, <em>i.e.</em>, such that the general
public's understanding of the subject matter in question likely will be
enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent.

<P>This final step in the &quot;public interest&quot; analysis requires an agency
to focus as realistically as possible on the precise nature of the public
contribution likely to result from a disclosure. It necessarily involves
an assessment of the likely impact of the disclosure on the public's understanding
of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public understanding
of that subject existing prior to the disclosure. A differential analysis
between the two should be undertaken in order to determine whether the
contribution likely to result from the disclosure can be regarded as &quot;significant.&quot;

<P>The determination of &quot;significance,&quot; which will require the exercise
of especially careful judgment in many cases, is essentially an objective
rather than a subjective determination. The agency's decision properly
turns on whether the disclosure is likely to lead to a significant contribution
to public understanding. This does not permit a separate value judgment
by the agency as to whether the information, even though it in fact would
contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities
of the government, is &quot;important&quot; enough to be made public.

<P>If the agency determines that the likely contribution to public understanding
is significant -- and each agency disclosing its own records under the
FOIA is in the best position to evaluate the disclosable portions and reach
such a judgment regarding their likely contribution to public understanding
of government operations or activities -- then the fee waiver standard's
&quot;public interest&quot; requirement is fully satisfied.
</p>

<P>B. Disclosure of the Information &quot;is Not Primarily in the Commercial
Interest of the Requester.&quot;

<P>Once an agency is satisfied that the first requirement for a fee waiver
has been met, the statutory standard then requires a determination of whether
disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial
interest of the requester; if it is, then a waiver is not warranted. To
apply this second basic requirement, an agency must determine the magnitude
of any commercial interest of the requester (or person upon whose behalf
the requester may be acting) that would be furthered by disclosure, and
then compare it to that of the public interest already identified.</p>

<dd>(1) <B>The Existence and Magnitude of a Commercial Interest:</B> Whether
the Requester has a Commercial Interest that Would be Furthered by the
Requested Disclosure.

<P>An agency must first determine as a threshold matter whether the request
involves any commercial interest of the requester and, if so, assess the
magnitude of that commercial interest. Only commercial interests that would
be served by disclosure -- as opposed to other personal, non-commercial
interests -- should be considered. A &quot;commercial interest&quot; is one that
furthers a commercial, trade or profit interest as those terms are commonly
understood. <em>See</em> OMB Fee Guidelines, sec. 6g. <em>Accord, e.g.,
American Airlines, Inc. v. National Mediation Board</em>, 588 F.2d 863,
870 (2d Cir. 1978) (defining &quot;commercial&quot; in Exemption 4 as meaning anything
&quot;pertaining or relating to or dealing with commerce&quot;); <em>see also
Critical Mass Energy Project v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n</em>, 644 F.
Supp. 344, 346 (D.D.C. 1986) (entity's &quot;non-profit status is not by itself
determinative&quot;) (appeal pending). Thus, not only profit-making corporations
but individuals or other organizations may have a commercial interest to
be served by disclosure, depending upon the circumstances involved.

<P>If the requester's interest in the records sought is unclear, it is
entirely proper for agencies to consider and draw reasonable inferences
from the requester's identity and the circumstances surrounding the request
in determining the existence of a commercial interest. Where an agency
reasonably believes that such circumstances suggest the existence of a
commercial interest in disclosure, the requester should be given an opportunity
in the administrative process to provide further information rebutting
such reasonable inferences or clarifying the circumstances of the request
where necessary. <em>Accord National Treasury Employees Union v.
Griffin</em>, 811 F.2d at 647; <em>see also</em> OMB Fee Guidelines,
sec. 6g.

<P>Where a commercial interest is found to exist, and it would be furthered
through the disclosure sought, the magnitude of that commercial interest
must then be assessed. In making such an assessment, an agency should reasonably
consider the role that such FOIA-disclosed information plays with respect
to the requester's commercial interests, as well as the extent to which
FOIA disclosures serve those interests overall.</p>

<dd>(2) <B>The Primary Interest in Disclosure:</B> Whether the Magnitude
of the Identified Commercial Interest of the Requester is Sufficiently
Large, in Comparison with the Public Interest in Disclosure, that Disclosure
is &quot;Primarily in the Commercial Interest of the Requester.&quot;

<P>Once a requester's commercial interest has been found to exist, the
statute requires that an agency then determine whether disclosure of the
information would be &quot;primarily&quot; in that interest. This requires the balancing
of the requester's commercial interest against the public interest in disclosure
that has been identified. Fundamentally, this balancing process is the
same as that required under the previous fee waiver standard -- except
that, once the more specific &quot;public interest&quot; standard is satisfied, the
balance is now only between the magnitude of the public interest and the
magnitude of requester's commercial interest, as those terms are used in
the statute.

<P>Where the &quot;public interest&quot; standard is satisfied as discussed above,
and that public interest can fairly be regarded as greater in magnitude
than the requester's commercial interest in disclosure, a fee waiver or
reduction must be granted. Conversely, even where sufficient public interest
exists to meet that more particular standard, a fee waiver is not warranted
under the statute if the requester's commercial interest in disclosure
is found to be greater than the public interest to be served, because disclosure
would then be &quot;primarily&quot; in the requester's commercial interest.

<P>Such comparisons, of course, require careful attention. For example,
although newsgathering organizations usually have a commercial interest
in obtaining information, the traditional process of newsgathering and
dissemination by established news media organizations, as a rule, should
not be considered to be &quot;primarily&quot; in their commercial interest; because
of their established role in providing information to the general public,
it ordinarily can be presumed that, if a significant public interest has
been identified, that will be the interest &quot;primarily&quot; served by disclosure
to such organizations. On the other hand, the disclosure of agency records
to data brokers or others who compile and market government information
for direct economic return can more readily be considered as primarily
in the commercial interests of the requester, depending on the nature of
the records and the exact circumstances of the enterprise.

<P>In the final analysis, each agency is best situated to make comparative
assessments of the likely effects of disclosure of its own records; the
statutory standard certainly affords agencies sufficient discretion with
which to do so.

<P>In making the subtle and sometimes difficult determinations required
under the revised fee waiver standard, agencies should nevertheless strive
to be as efficient as reasonably possible in expending agency resources
on them. All fee waiver requesters, however, are entitled to full and careful
consideration of the merits of their requests. <SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP>
Where agencies undertake a fee waiver analysis according to the logical
sequence of factors outlined in this guidance memorandum, they can confidently
discharge their statutory obligations.

<P>In addition to the foregoing guidance on the substantive factors to
be considered in making fee waiver decisions, agencies should continue
to refer to the procedural guidance with respect to fee waiver questions
published in the January 1983 issue of <em>FOIA Update</em>, which remains
effective. That guidance advises, for example, that agencies may grant
a fee waiver in a percentage commensurate to the proportion of disclosable
records that satisfy the statutory fee waiver standard. <em>See FOIA
Update</em>, Jan. 1983, at 4.

<P>Should any executive agency's administrative or legal personnel have
any question regarding the implementation or interpretation of the new
statutory fee waiver standard, they may contact the Department of Justice's
Office of Information and Privacy, at (FTS) 633-3642 (633-FOIA).
  <p>_______________________________________</p>

<P><A NAME="N_1_"></A>1. This guidance supersedes the previous fee waiver
guidance issued by the Department of Justice in January 1983 and November
1986, and is effective with respect to fee waiver determinations made as
of April 25, 1987. It interrelates in part with the OMB Fee Guidelines.
Additionally, agencies considering fee waiver issues should note particularly
the new specific fee limitation provisions to be found at 5 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect;
552(a)(4)(A)(ii),</nobr> (iv), as amended, which are addressed in the OMB Fee
Guidelines.

<P><A NAME="N_2_"></A>2. <em>United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp.</em>,
465 U.S. 792, 798 (1984) (FOIA decision applying statutory language on
its face); <em>see also CIA v. Sims</em>, 471 U.S. 159, 167
(1985) (the &quot;plain meaning&quot; of such statutory terms should be applied).
Decisions applying the language of the previous FOIA fee waiver standard
are cited in this memorandum only where their holdings are consistent with
the plain language of the revised standard.

<P>Because of the accelerated procedures by which Congress enacted the
Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, of which the Freedom of Information Reform
Act was a part, at the close of the 99th Congress, there exists no committee
report or actual floor debate on the revised fee provisions of the FOIA,
although several prepared statements were inserted into the Congressional
Record by Senators Hatch and Leahy and Congressmen English and Kindness.
As regards the new statutory fee waiver standard, its plain meaning may
readily be determined from its language.

<P><A NAME="N_3_"></A>3. The 1986 amendments to the FOIA added a new clause
(vi) providing that &quot;Nothing in this subparagraph [containing the FOIA's
fee provisions] shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically
providing for setting the level of fees for particular types of records.&quot;
5 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect; 552(a)(4)(A)(vi).</nobr> Accordingly, this guidance does not apply
to fee waivers sought in connection with requests for Defense Department
technical data that are subject to the separate statutory fee and fee waiver
scheme to be codified at 10 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect; 2328.</nobr> It also does not apply
to fees assessed or fee waivers sought in connection with requests for
information provided by the National Technical Information Service, <em>see</em>
15 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect; 1153</nobr> (1982), or in connection with a request for records
under any other statute providing for the separate charging of fees within
the meaning of this provision. <em>See</em> OMB Fee Guidelines, sec. 6b.
Fees and, if applicable, fee waivers for such records should be determined
according to the standards provided in those statutes, not according to
the FOIA.

<P><A NAME="N_4_"></A>4. By its terms, the revised fee waiver standard
provides that the two statutory requirements it contains must be met before
the requester is entitled to a waiver or reduction of fees. It does not,
however, automatically require a complete waiver of all fees whenever those
requirements are met; <nobr>&sect; 552(a)(4)(A)(iii)</nobr> instead provides that &quot;[d]ocuments
shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the
[otherwise applicable] fees&quot; if both requirements of the fee waiver standard
are met.

<P>As a matter of course, the Department of Justice encourages agencies
to provide a waiver of fees when both requirements of the statutory standard
are met, just as they must deny a waiver of fees whenever one or both of
those requirements are not met.

<P>However, Congress in amending the FOIA specifically revised and retained
the reduction language in the fee waiver standard, and that language should
be read to have some effect. <em>Accord United States v. Menasche</em>,
348 U.S. 528, 538-39 (1955) (court has duty to give effect, if possible,
to every clause and word of statute); <em>see also Jarecki
v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.</em>, 367 U.S. 303, 307 (1961). Therefore, in rare
cases, perhaps involving exceptional burden or expenditure of public resources
in the context of a request that minimally satisfies the &quot;public interest&quot;
requirement, it may be possible to give effect to the language of the statute
providing for &quot;a charge reduced below the [otherwise applicable] fees&quot;
by granting a reduction rather than a complete waiver of fees.

<P><A NAME="N_5_"></A>5. The term &quot;representative of the news media&quot; appears
in 5 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect; 552(a)(4)(A)(ii),</nobr> which precludes the charging of search
fees to certain categories of requesters. Though that term does not appear
in the fee waiver standard of the Act, <nobr>&sect; 552(a)(4)(A)(iii),</nobr> the fact
that a request is from a &quot;representative of the news media&quot; for purposes
of clause (ii) is clearly a relevant factor in evaluating a waiver or reduction
of duplication charges under the fee waiver standard of clause (iii).

<P><A NAME="N_6_"></A>6. Decisions on fee waiver requests are matters committed
to the exercise of sound agency discretion in the first instance. Once
a fee waiver issue proceeds to court, however, a new judicial review provision
included in the amended FOIA, 5 U.S.C. <nobr>&sect; 552(a)(4)(A)(vii),</nobr> provides
for review of agency fee waiver denials according to a <em>de novo</em>
standard, as opposed to the more deferential &quot;arbitrary or capricious&quot;
standard previously employed.

<P>The scope of judicial review of fee waiver determinations, however,
remains limited to the administrative record established before the agency.
<em>Id</em>. As a general rule of administrative law, this record ordinarily
cannot be supplemented in litigation either by the agency or by the requester.
<em>See, e.g., National Treasury Employees Union v. Griffin</em>,
811 F.2d at 648. It therefore is imperative that an agency create a comprehensive
administrative record of each fee waiver denial, specifying in as much
detail as reasonably possible each of the grounds upon which it is based.
<em>See FOIA Update</em>, Winter 1985, at 6.

<P>It should be noted, however, that the <em>de novo</em> review standard
of <nobr>&sect; 552(a)(4)(A)(vii)</nobr> applies by its terms only to the &quot;waiver of
fees,&quot; <em>i.e.</em>, to determinations made under clause (iii). Thus, agency
determinations of fee assessments made under any other provision of <nobr>&sect;
552(a)(4)(A)</nobr> should continue to be subject to judicial review according
to the traditional &quot;arbitrary or capricious&quot; standard.
