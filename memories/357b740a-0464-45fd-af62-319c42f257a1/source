	<p>
		In early 2011 I released a small experiment called Sketch. It's a drawing application where lines appear to vibrate slightly 
		like in an old cartoon. Sketches can be saved to a unique link and when shared, the sketch will replay as it was originally 
		drawn.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sketch saw a good amount of interest right off the bat and I was really excited when it crossed 100,000 saved drawings. After 
		that initial rush however it quieted down quickly. Nothing unexpected there, that's the lifecycle I've come to expect from 
		releasing many different personal projects and experiments. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Fast forward to late November 2012.
	</p>
	<p>
		Out of nowhere Sketch started seeing a lot of traffic from a site that I'd never heard the name of before: <a href="http://ask.fm">ask.fm</a>. 
		According to Wikipedia <q>"ask.fm is an interest-based social Q&amp;A website"</q> though I'm still not entirely sure what that means. From 
		there it continued to spread to other sites and at the time of writing Facebook is the biggest referrer. 
	</p>
	<h3>Scaling up</h3>
	<p>
		The traffic spike ended up being much too heavy for my old host to handle and the server started breaking down during peak hours with a few
		thousand concurrent visitors. It was pretty excruciating. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I ended up migrating the project &mdash; including a 5GB MySQL databse &mdash; to a new Linux server on <a href="aws.amazon.com">AWS</a>. This 
		was challenging considering I've never set up and configured a server before but it was definitely worth it. After working through the initial  
		quirks of getting everything up and running it's been much easier to monitor and scale up further. There's also been further optimization like 
		moving all static assets to a CDN, adding a large cache layer in front of database read/writes and frequently sharding tables. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Beyond changing servers I also felt it was time for a new name since Sketch was too generic. I ended up going with Sketch Toy 
		which had the big plus of a free domain, Facebook and Twitter name: 
		<br>- <a href="http://sketchtoy.com">sketchtoy.com</a> 
		<br>- <a href="http://twitter.com/sketchtoy">twitter.com/sketchtoy</a> 
		<br>- <a href="http://facebook.com/sketchtoy">facebook.com/sketchtoy</a>
	</p>
	<h3>Challenges</h3>
	<p>
		It's been about a month since traffic first surged and it has now stabilized at 800k-1m visits per day. During peak hours that means 
		somewhere around 10-13k concurrent visitors which is very strenuous even with the new setup and probably won't scale much further. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The second challenge is storage. Sketches are saved as compressed JSON blobs but with around 400k saves per day, the databse is still 
		growing by a few GB each week. Unfortunately I believe the only real solution to this is to delete old sketches with few views.
	</p>
	<p>
		But these are fun problems to have. It's been a great opportunity to learn about server configuration and I look forward to continuing 
		to learn more as I go.
	</p>

		Almost two years after releasing the <a href="http://www.sinuousgame.com">web version</a> Sinuous has finally

		The game is still powered by JavaScript and rendered on HTML canvas. It relies on native code for

		I'm very happy with how well the controls translated to touch and I hope you will be too.

<p>
	Decided it was time for some CSS tinkering again and ended up creating this set of CSS3 scrolling styles. 
	Not intended for any practical use but the visuals are surprisingly impactful.
</p>
<p>
	This works by applying a <code>future</code>/<code>past</code> class to list items outside of the viewport 
	as you scroll. Based on this class a variety of transforms are transitioned to via CSS.

<div class="two-columns">
	<p>
		It's that time of the year again! In late 2010, having spent five great years working at 
		<a href="http://www.f-i.com">Fi</a>, I was determined to change up my professional life. After 
		interviewing with <a href="http://www.qwiki.com">Qwiki</a> and accepting the position of Lead 
		Interactive Developer it was decided; I was moving to San Francisco! It took a good few months of
		hard work to sort out all of the practicalities but it was definitely worth it now that I'm here.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fortunately I've still been able to keep this site updated and worked on a variety of projects 
		and experiments throughout the year. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The first project to see the light of day was <a href="http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/sketch/">Sketch</a>, 
		a drawing tool that mimics the style of old cartoons. It was refreshing to build something that allows 
		others to be creative. Now – almost a year later – over 78,000 sketches have been saved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sketch was followed by a short freelance project which involved building an interactive and animated 
		logo for a Canadian media production company called Yugen. Try it out on their site;
		<a href="http://yugen.ca/">http://yugen.ca/</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next I stumbled into the land of CSS3 3D transforms and ended up trying them out on two projects;
		<a href="http://hakim.se/experiments/css/holobox/">Holobox</a> and CSS3 3D Slideshow (later renamed 
		<a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js</a>). A few weeks ago, in mid December, I resumed 
		my CSS 3D pursuits by creating a <a href="http://hakim.se/thoughts/rolling-links">rolling effect</a> 
		for links and building a <a href="http://hakim.se/experiments/domtree">Christmas tree</a> out of form elements.

		Being far from tired of working with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> I also created a new game called 
		<a href="http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/coil/">Coil</a>, it's similar in design to <a href="http://sinuousgame.com">Sinuous</a> 
		but adds a touch of WebGL and perhaps an element of stress to the gameplay. Shortly thereafter I worked on a 
		tool called <a href="http://textify.it">Textify.it</a> which allows you to recreate images using thousands
		of letters of text. Using Phonegap, I was able to easily port <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/textify-it/id441057755">Textify.it to iOS</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's been really encouraging to see that there's still a lot of activity on <a href="http://sinuousgame.com">sinuousgame.com</a>
		even though it's been out since 2010 – meaning ancient, in internet-time. In the past year it saw more than 2,000,000 visits.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now the new year is approaching and with it new adventures. 2012 will start with relocating to NYC and 
		opening up Qwiki's new office. Can't wait to see where it goes from there!

<p>
	Happy holidays! I didn't get a pine tree for Christmas this year so I decided 
	to compensate by creating a digital counterpart out of HTML form elements.
</p>
<p>
	The DOM tree is generated via JavaScript every time you visit the page so you'll
	never see the same one twice. All of the forms are filled with holiday greetings 
	in a variety of languages. CSS3 3D transforms are used to position and rotate, via
	<code>translate3d()</code> and <code>rotate3d()</code> respectively, the  elements 
	when the page loads. The infinitely looping rotation on the tree is controlled by 
	an infinitely looping CSS3 animation.
</p>
<p>
	All of the form inputs are interactive so I challenge you to try and select some of 
	those <code>&lt;input type="radio"&gt;</code> snow flakes!

		I was really happy with how the <a href="http://textify.it">Textify.it</a> web app turned 
		out and decided it was worthwhile creating a version targeted at iOS. I've been curious 
		about the potential of building iOS apps using the standard array of open web technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the help of <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, a framework which bridges 
		JavaScript to native functionality, it was incredibly easy to get going. The iOS version of 
		Textify.it is based on the same JavaScript core as the online version. Some code was added to 
		fire up the camera/library as well as for saving images onto the device.
	</p>
	<p>
		One challenge with any HTML app targeted at iOS and Mobile Safari is rendering performance, 
		particularly so when using the HTML5 canvas element. The mobile version of Textify.it maintains
		the original resolution of images and those images may well be 2048x1536 pixels large (iPhone 3GS). 
		The most fruitful optimization for this was to use a CSS transform to scale the canvas rather
		than doing so via its width/height properties. This seems to force the browser to apply a different, faster, 
		image scaling method. Jonas Wagner has written a post about a similar technique for improved 
		performance <a href="http://29a.ch/2011/5/27/fast-html5-canvas-on-iphone-mobile-safari-performance">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Textify.it is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textify-it/id441057755">available for both iPhone and iPad</a>
		with a $0.99 price tag.

	<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/portfolio/images/canvas-optimization.jpg" alt="Coil Debug Mode" width="695" height="280">
</a>
<div class="two-columns">
	<p>
		Building <a href="/experiments/html5/coil">Coil</a> presented me with a few interesting technical 
		challenges. Primarily I had a hard time making the game operate at a reasonable framerate since it uses both 
		2D Canvas <em>and</em> WebGL. Double whammy. Even though I am still not fully satisfied with how the game performs, 
		I wanted to share some of the optimization techniques used. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Redraw Regions</h3>
	<p>
		The best <code>canvas</code> optimization technique for animations is to limit the amount of pixels 
		that get cleared/painted on each frame. The easiest solution to implement is resetting the entire canvas element
		and drawing everything anew but that is an expensive operation for your browser to process. 
	</p>
	<p>
		To limit the areas which are cleared in Coil, I keep track of exactly which rectangular regions are being painted in 
		so that I can then <code>clearRect(x,y,w,h)</code> only those. This results in the following flow:
		<br/><br/>
		1. Clear pixels of all redraw regions<br/>
		2. Reset redraw region list<br/>
		3. Paint all elements and store their individual redraw regions<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Coil has a debug mode in which these redraw regions are displayed as green rectangles, 
		<a href="/experiments/html5/coil?debug=1">try it out</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Procedural Sprites</h3>
	<p>
		Even though I'm an advocate for generating graphics procedurally, sometimes that's not the most efficient
		approach. If you're drawing simple shapes with solid fills then by all means drawing them procedurally 
		is the way to go. But if you're drawing more detailed entities with strokes, gradient fills and other
		performance sensitive make-up you'd be better off using image sprites. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In Coil I use a hybrid approach. Graphical entities are generated procedurally on <code>canvas</code>, but
		only once as the game starts up. For the rest of the game's lifespan I paint copies of those sprites rather 
		than repeatedly generate the same drop-shadow, gradient and strokes.
	</p>
	<p>
		One final tip when working with image sprites is to always draw them on integer x/y coordinates for better
		performance on OS X browsers. You can read about this in greater detail 
		<a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/2011/02/html5-canvas-sprite-optimisation/">here</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Computation Distribution</h3>
	<p>
		The Chrome Developer Tools <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/profiles.html">profiler</a> is 
		very useful for finding out what your performance bottlenecks are. In my case, for Coil, the two heaviest operations 
		were the discovery of enclosures and rendering of WebGL. Both of these operations were being executed on every frame.
	</p>
	<p>
		To distribute the processing for these two operations I changed it so that enclosure discovery only occurs on <em>even</em> 
		frames while WebGL only gets rendered on <em>odd</em> frames.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Performance Based Scoring</h3>
	<p>
		From a scoring point of view, bad performance can be beneficial when playing a reflex based game since it 
		gives you more time to react. To combat this unfair advantage I scale down the scores by a factor of the
		current FPS divided by the target FPS.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another, perhaps more elegant, solution to this problem is to base all game mechanics on time rather than 
		frames.

<p>
	While working on <a href="/experiments/sinuous/">Sinuous</a> I had an idea for a gameplay feature 
	that involved drawing circles around your enemies to destroy them. Trying not to add too many 
	features in one game I decided not to implement it at that point and instead revisit it as a separate 
	game.
</p>
<p>
	Much like Sinuous, Coil is a very straight forward game with as few features and gameplay elements as 
	possible.
</p>
<p>
	The objective is to defeat enemies by enclosing them in the trail formed by your tail. Enemies found 
	within those closures are obliterated. There are two types of enemies; the <span style="color: blue">blue</span> 
	kind explodes after time and causes you damage, <span style="color: red">red</span> enemies on the other 
	hand are obstacles which should never be drawn into the enclosed area as that will also cause you damage.
</p>
<p>
	Determining how to isolate enclosed areas, and enemies therein, was a very interesting challenge. 
	The final implementation is a three-step process. First I check all line segments in the tail for 
	intersections with each other. Once an intersection is discovered, that enclosed area is filled with
	a unique color. Finally, collisions are found by checking if the color underneath an enemy matches the 
	closure's unique fill color.

	After seeing a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erf8yA_4pPI">video</a> demonstration 
	of a holographic effect created with HTML/CSS I was inspired to build something similar. I ended up creating a 
	3D box which alters perspective depending on device orientation.
</p>
<p>
	CSS3 3D transforms are used to distort HTML elements and create the walls of the box. JavaScript then tracks 
	the <code>deviceorientation</code> and <code>devicemotion</code> events and updates the 3D perspective 
	accordingly. The only property that is being changed via JavaScript is the perspective origin, or
	<code>-webkit-perspective-origin</code> to be exact.

	WebGL's introduction is very exciting due to the powerful graphical capabilities it enables in the 
	browser context. This power originates from the ability to run highly optimized programs on the GPU 
	via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader">shaders</a> written in the 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLSL">OpenGL Shading Language</a> – or 
	GLSL for short. 
</p>
<p>
	There are two types of shaders; <strong>vertex shaders</strong> which are used to calculate 
	transformations of vertices and <strong>fragment shaders</strong> which are used to process 
	indiviual pixels.
</p>
<p>
	Aiming to start learning more about the GLSL language I wrote a few abstract fragment shaders. 
	To avoid some of the rudimentary work I used <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a> 
	to compile and run my shaders. I've also been referencing the wonderful 
	<a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/apps/shadertoy/">Shader Toy</a> for learning examples.

<p>
	While preparing a presentation on SVG for an upcoming <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/stockholm-web-monkeys">Stockholm Web Monkeys</a> 
	meetup I needed to construct a simple slideshow. Since this would only ever be presented in a 
	controlled environment, I decided to take the opportunity and experiment with CSS 3D transforms.
</p>
<p>
	The transition between slides is made possible by a combination of CSS 3D transforms and
	transitions. JavaScript is in charge of updating the class names of all slides depending user
	input and CSS takes it from there. Thanks to the limited logic involved I was also able to
	avoid using any third party libraries.
</p>
<p>
	Each slide can contain a nested slideshow. The top level slideshow is navigated via
	keyboard left/right and the nested slideshows are then reached by using the up/down arrows.
</p>
<p>
	Tip: you can improve the rendering performance of transitions/animations in mobile Safari by 
	applying a dummy CSS 3D transform. For example: <code>-webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0)</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Note that this requires a browser with support for CSS3 3D transforms, such as 
	<a href="http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/snapshots/">Chromium</a> or mobile Safari.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>02-08-2011:</strong> The slideshow now provides unique URL's per slide which in turn 
	enables support for internal links.

		In early 2011 I collaborated with Canadian media production company 
		<a href="http://yugen.ca/">Yugen</a> on a small but very interesting project. 
		The objective was to "...produce a code generated logo that reacts to various inputs..." 
		and works on all platforms. Having looked at the fluid shape in the logo design I felt this 
		would be a lot of fun to take on – and so I did.
	</p>
	<p>
		I animated the logo using the HTML <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element and created a fallback 
		with rotating images for sans <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> browsers. The animtion consists of a
		few core properties of the logo, such as shape and color, changing slowly using a fine 
		combination of randomness and control. Realizing that it would take some value tweaking for 
		everyone involved to be satisfied with the look and feel, I provided an easy way for Yugen to 
		configure the logo. If you're curious about how this looks you can view the source of  
		<a href="http://yugen.ca/">this page</a> and look for <code>YugenLogo.initialize</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The animation also works with touch input and runs smoothly on most mobile devices. That latter 
		part is somewhat of a surprise since everything I've done with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> up 
		till this point has always been dissapointingly slow in those environments. The primary reason 
		for why it works so well in this case is that it's rendered at a relatively small resolution.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm really happy with how this turned out in the end. The organic nature of the animation 
		compliments the logo design very well without sacrificing any of its core visual principles.

<div class="two-columns">
	<p>
		As the HTML5 spec is slowly making its way from working draft to recommendation and browser implementations 
		are solidifying – the urge to make use of these new features grows strong.
	</p>
	 
	<p>
		Coming from a Flash background, and being a sucker for anything that moves or can be interacted with, I am 
		most excited about the introduction of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element which allows for 
		bitmap drawing through JavaScript. I started creating some <a href="/experiments/">visual experiments</a> 
		using canvas a few months back and have gathered some tips for anyone dabbling in this neck of the woods.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Performance</h3>
	<p>
		When working with animation on canvas, performance can be a challenge since bitmap operations are very 
		processing expensive, especially at high resolutions. One important optimization rule to follow is to reuse 
		as many pixels as possible between frames. What I mean by that is the fewer pixels that need to be processed 
		each frame, the faster your program will run. For example, when erasing pixels with the 
		<code>clearRect(x,y,w,h)</code> method, it is very beneficial to clear and redraw only the pixels 
		that have changed and not the full canvas. Unlike the Flash Player’s redraw 
		regions, this management of “dirty rectangles” needs to be done manually for canvas.
	</p>
	 
	<h3>State Stack & Transformation</h3>
	<p>
		The canvas can be manipulated via transformations such as rotation and scaling, resulting in a change to the 
		canvas coordinate system. This is where it’s important to know about the state stack for which two methods are 
		available: <code>context.save()</code> (pushes the current state to the stack) and 
		<code>context.restore()</code> (reverts to the previous state). This enables you to apply 
		transformation to a drawing and then restore back to the previous state to make sure the next shape is not 
		affected by any earlier transformation. The states also include properties such as the fill and stroke colors.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Compositing</h3>
	<p>
		A very powerful tool at hand when working with canvas is compositing modes which, amongst other things, allow 
		for masking and layering. As an example you can check out Bakemono, where composite modes are used to mask 
		the eye and mouth. There's a wide array of available composite modes and they are all set through the canvas 
		context's <code>globalCompositeOperation</code> property.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Anti-Aliasing</h3>
	<p>
		To allow for sub-pixel drawings, all browser implementations of canvas employ anti-aliasing (although this 
		does not seem to be a requirement in the HTML5 spec). Anti-aliasing can be important to keep in mind if you 
		want to draw crisp lines and notice the result looks blurred. To work around this you will need to either 
		round to integer values or offset by half a pixel depending on if you’re drawing fills or strokes.
	</p>
	 
	<h3>Clearing the Canvas</h3>
	<p>
		To clear the entire canvas of any existing pixels <code>context.clearRect(x,y,w,h)</code> is
		typically used – but there is another option available. Whenever the width/height of the canvas are set, even if they 
		are set to the same value repeatedly, the canvas is reset. This is good to know when working with a 
		dynamically sized canvas as you will notice drawings disappearing.
	</p>
	 
	<h3>Next Steps</h3>
	<p>
		If you’re interested in learning more about canvas, I would suggest getting started by reading through Mark
		Pilgrim's wonderful 
		<a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html">Dive Into HTML5 chapter</a>.
		Once you're up and going this <a href="http://simon.html5.org/dump/html5-canvas-cheat-sheet.html">cheat sheet</a> 
		is a great point of reference.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
		Canvas has been around for quite a while already and is supported by all modern, and some not so modern, browsers. 
		This being the case, I think it’s very much ready to be used for real production. Some suitable places to utilize 
		canvas would be to enrich buttons, charts/data visualization and navigational elements such as a list of thumbnails 
		for an image gallery.

</a>
<p>
	Preceding the release of the Chrome Web Store (CWS) I collaborated with Google 
	to prepare Sinuous as a launch title app. Following the launch in early 
	December 2010, Sinuous saw a major increase in activity and players. In 
	fact, <a href="http://sinuousgame.com">sinuousgame.com</a> has 
	seen over <strong>900,000</strong> visits since its launch and traffic is now 
	resting at about 5k visits/day.
</p>
<p>
	There are two different ways to deploy apps on the CWS:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Offline apps that are downloaded to the client.</li>
	<li>Online apps that open an existing app URL.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	The latter has raised some discussion – and complaints – because it essentially 
	means that the "app" is no more than a bookmark. In some ways I agree with 
	this, but I still picked this route to avoid having to maintain and update separate 
	versions of the game.
</p>
<p>
	If my app is merely a link to the original game, why do I bother 
	to use the CWS at all? One reason: exposure. The CWS is a very powerful 
	promotional channel for finding an audience.
